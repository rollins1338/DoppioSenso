He couldn’t take his eyes off her from the very beginning. The woman was wearing a backless black dress that just barely managed to hide her bottom. Thanks to him, she had exercised to cultivate her captivating curves. Now she was finally revealing them to him. Below her dress, her curved hips and long legs were enough to draw the attention of every man at the party.
[May I ask you how long you’ll be in Hong Kong?]

As she pushed her glossy black hair back behind her ears, the woman raised her champagne flute and wet her lips. Her full lips stained in a deep red lipstick finally opened.
[I plan on staying for at least two months. I want to relax as much as I can before I start working. Even though it’s a blessing to be able to have a job right out of graduation, I won’t be able to take a vacation like this once I begin.]
Her scarlet tongue slipped out and licked the remaining liquor off her lips. The 0.5 carat diamond earrings on her ears sparkled as they reflected the lights in the terrace. However, these glittering jewels didn’t enter his eyes. The man was unable to take his eyes off of her tempting tongue.
[Then are you heading back to the United States after your two months are over?]
This woman had said that her father was Chinese and her mother was Korean. She also told him that she had gone to school in the States. When it came to beauty, nationality didn’t matter. She had the beauty to turn the heads of every man in any country.



[No, the office is located in London. My professor from my graduate university sent them a well-written recommendation letter.] 
The man swallowed, his mouth dry.

[I go to London often. What a happy coincidence.]

The woman’s big, innocent eyes looked at him questioningly. The man quickly explained.
[I own a gallery. It opened last year, so not a lot of people know about it.]
[How nice. If I ever pass by your gallery, I’ll be happy to see you.]
She added that she didn’t have any acquaintances in London as of yet, so it’d be nice to see a familiar face. She wrinkled her nose as she laughed affectionately. The man felt his cock stiffen and barely managed to keep his cool as he replied.
[Excuse me for being so forward, but I hope to tell you all about London during your stay in Hong Kong.]
The woman looked at him with her large eyes and blinked. The man wondered if he was being too obvious. However, the woman gave him a slight smile.
[It would be to my good fortune if you did.]

As the saying goes, a player recognizes a player. When the man saw the woman’s meaningful look, his heart skipped a beat and he felt heat rush throughout his body. He felt parched as he began to anticipate this woman’s body. Knowing that he’d be able to spend the night with her if he succeeded, he began to speak.
[Wouldn’t I be the lucky one?]



The man spoke faster with anticipation.

[You are so beautiful that I couldn’t take my eyes off you from the moment you entered this room. There’s no doubt that all the men here are envious of my position right now.]
[Haha.]

The woman’s clear voice as she laughed softly stimulated his primitive instincts. Her long, slender neck reminded him of a deer’s. He wanted to dig his teeth into it and make his mark on her.
[I know you may think that I’m just saying this, but… Honestly, it’s a good feeling. Am I being too superficial?]
Her eyes looked like black crystals as they sparkled. For a man whose hair was slicked back, the words that left his mouth were quite unexpected.
[You’re the brightest thing in this room. I often handle jewels, so I should know.”
[…A diamond will always shine brighter for those that know how to appraise it.]
She lowered her head slightly and looked at him. She was exuding sexiness and grace. Even though she said she graduated from school in the States, her Cantonese was incredibly proficient, probably stemming from her Chinese heritage. Her eyes were also very captivating. Additionally, she closed her eyes whenever she laughed, giving off a childlike impression. This gap between her innocence and sensuality whet his sexual appetite even more. He wanted to see her shake her hips like a temptress in bed no matter what.
[It seems that the bartender is a bit busy right now. Why don’t I go and get us another round of drinks. We’ll both have the same.]



In order to calm his arousal, the man took the champagne flute from the woman’s hand and raised it.
[May I order a cocktail this time?]

[Of course. Just tell me what you’d like and I’ll bring it to you.]
[Ah, if that’s the case then…]

Her long hair fluttered in the wind and her charming fragrance tickled his nose. She took a step towards him and gazed at him before clearly whispering…
[I’d like an ‘Orgasm’, please.]

Gulp. The man swallowed. The look in her coffee-colored eyes as she whispered her order let him know that she wasn’t talking about a cocktail. She was obviously seducing him.
[My home is only two blocks away from here…]

The woman smiled and tilted her head as if she didn’t know what he meant. If she was was trying to raise her self-worth by acting innocent, he would play along.
[My personal bar is quite adequate. Why don’t I make you that cocktail at my house?]
Seeing the desire in eyes, a smile stretched across her red lips as she let out a bewitching laugh.
[I think that’s a great idea.] [Haa…]
As the man entered the limousine, he began to slowly approach her. She licked her lip as if she was thirsty before frantically kissing him as if she couldn’t take it any longer.



Even though the separator was up, seeing as how the driver didn’t make a peep, EunHa realized that she was one of many women that this man had taken to his home. As the man sucked her tongue, their teeth almost knocked together in his haste. EunHa was becoming annoyed.
[Hmmm…]

As she let out an enchanting moan, she gripped his shirt. As she slightly pulled back, she could see that his face was covered in her lipstick. EunHa held back her laughter and furrowed her brow.
[It… It seems that I’ve had too much to drink tonight. I don’t think I should drink anymore.]
[We’ll arrive at my house if you wait a little longer. Why don’t you relax for a bit there?]
His lustful eyes blinked right in front of her. This man was Hong Kong’s most famous jeweler. Knowing that tons of priceless paintings were kept hidden in this man’s basement, how could she relax in his house? She had studied the blueprint to his enormous house for half a month to prepare for this day. She was now only two blocks away from entering his home.
[I’m sorry for the inconvenience.]

She placed her head on his chest as if she was feeling dizzy. The man’s lips approached her own as if he had been waiting for this. His excited hands began to rub her shoulders before slowly lowering to her chest as he began to caress her breast. She just let him be.
She needed to completely arouse this man. She needed to distract him. Once they reached his home, she wanted the time they spent in bed to be as short as possible.
Weewoo, weewoo.



When the man heard the noisy sound of sirens, he stopped moving. They could see the flashing red lights through the tinted windows of the white limousine.
[What happened?]

[It seems that a small accident has occurred.]

The driver replied. The man began to laugh as if the reassure EunHa.
[It doesn’t look like it’s a big accident. If you’re here with me, you’ll be safe.]
[Alright.]

EunHa put on a relieved expression as she gazed at this man full of bravado. She wanted to reach his house as soon as possible, but this unexpected accident was putting her off schedule. It would be troublesome if this shattered his haze of arousal. She pretended to unintentionally place her delicate, manicured hand on his thigh. Suddenly…
Vrrrr.

The moment she put a charming smile on her face, her cellphone in her clutch began to vibrate. EunHa’s perfectly groomed eyebrows twitched. Only one person would be calling her cellphone right now. This was because only a limited number of people knew this number.
She almost never had a reason to answer her phone while she was working, but now that her phone had rang, she couldn’t ignore it. EunHa did her best to hide her displeasure and took her hand off her target.
[Please excuse me. My parents are quite strict, so they’ll worry if I don’t answer their call.]



[No worries. Please answer the call.]

The man seemed to be feel frustrated with his bowtie and undid a button on his shirt. Seeing him barely hold himself back from taking her, she felt a little better.
[Then…]

She took out the noisily vibrating phone and put it up to her ear. She didn’t forget to stick a bit closer to the man as she answered the call.
[Hello?]
– Withdraw right now.
Hearing the unexpected order, EunHa’s face hardened. She turned her gaze to the window as she pressed the phone to her ear. She answered in a calm voice.
“I think the party is going to go on for a little longer.”

The ex-girlfriend of the man sitting next to her had been a Korean model. When they had been dating, he poured out his money for her. However, after they broke up, there were rumors going around that he had demanded for his money back and even hired a lawyer.
EunHa wanted to ask, ‘Just what kind of bullshit are you spewing?’ However, just in case this man understood Korean, she held it back and kept her cover.
⦁	Hail a cab and go straight to the airport. Once you’re there, someone will be waiting for you. Your flight is in two and a half hours, so hurry up.
EunHa bit the inside of her cheek. She wanted to scream out in anger, but she suppressed the urge and clenched her teeth.



“What do you mean? Father has suddenly become ill?”
⦁	I’m telling you to stop what you’re doing and get out of there. Do you not understand?
She couldn’t accept the sudden change in plans. Additionally, the plan was even going as planned, so how could she quit now? EunHa’s voice was laced with unrepressed rage.
“Why are you suddenly being like this?”
⦁	It’s Boss’s orders.
It was a short answer, but enough. She let out an angry curse. She felt the man next to her flinch. She wasn’t sure about anything else, but he certainly understood that curse word. EunHa closed her eyes and took a deep breath. She managed to end the call after saying a few more pleasantries.
[I’m so sorry, but I think I need to head back.] [What do you mean?]
The man looked at her in disbelief. EunHa understood how he felt. But the person who felt the most frustrated right now was her. She had to let go of her prey.
[My parents said that something urgent has come up. I see you another time.]
As she indifferently muttered her excuse, she reached for the door handle. However, he quickly grabbed her wrist.
[It’s a shame for you to just leave like this.]

There was a savage gleam in his eyes. He had been irked by her tone of voice as she spoke to him.
[You don’t know it, but I’m extremely upset right now as



well.]

If she wanted to catch that flight in two and a half hours, she needed to catch a taxi right this instant… and even then she might not make it. She snatched her hand out of his grasp. His anger began to show on his face.
[Are you joking?]

[I wish this was a joke, mister.]

[Just a minute ago, you were seducing me like a hooker.
Now just where do you think you’re going?]

Throwing away his gentleman’s facade, the man began to breathe heavily.
[Just drive.]

He ordered the driver. The driver hesitated before taking his foot of the brake. He then began turning the steering wheel as they headed into an alleyway. The car steadily began to move.
“Hey. You’re gonna regret this.” [What?]
“You put something in my drink back there, didn’t you?
Even if you can’t be a gentleman, you shouldn’t be a thug.”

EunHa looked at him as she spoke in Korean. The man grabbed her long hair.
[What are you mumbling about? Come here right now…!]

Her doll-like face twisted into an ugly expression.

“I guess this bastard doesn’t understand. Now I think I know why you were dumped.”



EunHa grabbed her clutch and pulled out her lipstick bullet. She pressed one end of it, and a needle popped out. The man was slobbering all over her neck as he nibbled it. EunHa quickly stabbed the needle into his back.
[Ugh…!]

As she injected the contents of the syringe into him, the man raised his hand and groaned. It took a bit of time for the sedative to take effect, so the man was still alert.
[You crazy… Ugh!]

The man slammed EunHa down onto the seats and began to pull himself down on top of her. EunHa quickly stabbed his groin with the heel of her stilettos. Suffering incredible pain, the man forgot how to breathe. EunHa clicked her tongue.
“You should have let me go nicely. Why’d you have to go and act so indecently?”
[Are you alright, sir?]

After hearing the struggle in the back, the driver stopped the car and looked back. At the same time, a studded clutch flew into his face.
“He’s probably not alright.” [Uugh!]
The driver grabbed his nose and groaned. Shocked, he took his foot off the brake pedal, and the car began to slowly move again. EunHa didn’t hesitate and opened the car door. She got out and rolled onto the ground.
[Stop the car!]



The man inside the car yelled out through the open door, creating a scene. EunHa got up from the ground and thought for a second. Then she took off her stiletto and raised it above her head. Either way, she wouldn’t be able to run properly in heels like these. She pulled her arm back and threw it. The stiletto flew through the air and hit the man square in the cheek.
[Hey, stop right there!]

The man got out of the car, but his legs gave out underneath him. he stumbled onto the ground. The driver got out and was just about to run after EunHa when he stopped to help his employer.
[I’m fine. Go catch that bitch…!]

As an uproar began to rise in front of the limousine, a police overseeing the minor crash caused by a drunk driver turned his head and looked over.
[What’s going on here?]

They weren’t happy to see a policeman in this situation. Thankfully, the major road was currently jammed. EunHa threw her other stiletto away and began to run barefoot for the major road.
The mermaid-dress wrapped around her legs, making it hard to run. She stretched out her hand and ripped the slit up further until it reached her thighs. She was finally able to run comfortably.
“Haa… Haa…!”

Whistle.

A few foreigners standing in line in front of a club whistled at her as they saw her running past them with her hair flying behind her.
[Where are you going? Let’s have some fun together, baby!]



“Baby? Go fuck yourselves, you bastards!”

She slapped their hands away as they reached for her. She ran around the corner and came across a juice cafe that had closed due to the late time. She ran to the building next to it and opened the door. Thankfully, these doors weren’t locked because of the 24-hour convenience store inside.
She passed a second-hand luxury-brand shop and exited to the alleyway on her right. She saw a bar that a lot of the Hong Kong businessmen frequented. There were usually a lot of cabs on standby in areas where the graceful hostesses sold their bodies. Worried that a cop was following her, she needed to escape before things became even more troublesome. EunHa ran, her lungs feeling as if they’d burst with exertion.
“Aaah, fuck… Seriously…!”

Was this her punishment for eating a pile of hamburgers for lunch today? She pointlessly thought as she ran with all her might. She finally saw the blinking pink sign. She saw a man in a suit and a barely-clothed woman get ready to enter the taxi. But EunHa didn’t have time to wait for another cab.
[Wait! Oppa! Unnie!]

The couple was about to take the taxi to a hotel. However, EunHa pushed them away and got into the taxi before slamming the door shut. The couple looked shocked at having their taxi taken away.
[The airport. Immediately. Keep the change.]

Confused, the taxi driver watched as she took out a wad of bills. He quickly shifted gears and began to drive.
[What do you think you’re doing?!]

Vrooom.



EunHa lowered the window and looked back at the angrily shouting man. She gestured to the man with her hand.
[I’m sorry. But ahjussi, your zipper’s open. Wow, you’ve got quite a package.]
[Wh-what?]

[If you’re going to date the pretty unnie next to you, you’re gonna need one anyway. You pass!]
EunHa’s eyes crinkled as she smiled and she gave him a thumbs up. The man quickly began to zip up his pants as his neck reddened. EunHa’s ebony hair flew in the wind. The woman next to him blinked in confusion.
The blue taxi drove through the narrow street as it finally exited the alleyway. EunHa let out a sigh and leaned back against the headrest. The red-light district of Lan Kwai Fong was getting further and further away.
TN: To all of you who stuck through Stigma, a round of applause
□□□! That was not an easy novel to read, but we did it! I don’t know about you, but I am emotionally exhausted.
Now, moving on to Doppio Senso… Right off the bat, a long prologue! I had to split it into two parts to make it more manageable.
What do you think about the spunky FL?? She’s definitely not virginal… not at all. From what I’ve read so far, she uses her sexuality as a weapon LOL. She’s gonna use what the good lord gave her and do what she has to do to get what she wants. So if you’re only into innocent, pure FL’s, turn back now! This isn’t the book for you!






KyungHyun was walking into his office when he suddenly stopped. His secretary was on maternity leave, and the woman sitting at her desk was looking up at him with wide, shocked eyes.
“…Who are you?”

KyungHyun stiﬄy asked the woman. General Manager Cha spoke up from his side.
“She is the new secretary that will be assisting you. She was recommended to us by Secretary Yoon and has just finished her training.”
Under his breath, the general manager murmured, ‘She doesn’t look bad at all.’ Then he addressed the new secretary.
“This man is Director Shin KyungHyun. You will be assisting him, Secretary Lee.”
“I’ll do my best. I’ll be in your care, sir.”

EunHa lowered her head politely. KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed as he watched her. She was dressed completely differently than when they had met at the squash courts three days ago. Instead of her light athletic clothes that made her seem like a bubbly college student, she was now wearing a tight skirt that stopped at her knees with a cobalt blouse.
Her clothing accentuated her delicate waist and the curves of her bosom so well that they seemed to be made for her body. Her ankles above her high heels looked dangerously slender. After he thoroughly looked her up and down, KyungHyun began to speak.



“Why don’t we talk in my office, Lee HaEun-ssi?”

KyungHyun said this so naturally that General Manager Cha didn’t realize that KyungHyun already knew her name. KyungHyun disappeared into his office and EunHa followed after him. The door closed firmly shut behind them.
“Since when?”

KyungHyun rested his elbows on the armrest of his chair and began to massage his temple. The air in the office suddenly became heavy.
“What do you mean?”

EunHa stared at him with a bit of embarrassment evident on her face, but KyungHyun didn’t give her the chance to refute.
“You approached me at the squash courts. Since when did you know who I was?”
“No one would approach their future boss like that on purpose, sir. If I knew back then, I wouldn’t have acted like that towards you.”
“So it was all just a coincidence?”

One time could be a coincidence, but not twice. From KyungHyun’s experience, rarely did a person approach him without knowing who he was. At his mocking glare, EunHa smiled awkwardly.
“I’m pretty unlucky.”

“Do you think you’re making sense right now?”

His low voice asked her slowly. His slow speech made her feel even more tense. EunHa bowed so low that her silky hair almost touched the floor. She did her best to keep her voice calm as she spoke.



“Please forgive me for being so rude back then, Director. Please forgive me just this once. I’ll do my best when it comes to this job, sir. It’s difficult to find a job in this climate, so I barely managed to get this position through a recommendation, sir.”
“Raise your head.”

KyungHyun’s voice was still sharp. EunHa kept her head bowed in silence. He spoke to her again with a cold voice.
“When you tell someone the truth, you should at least look the person in the eyes when you speak. The same goes for when you’re lying. If you avoid eye contact, one can’t help but think that you’re hiding a guilty conscience.”
Damn it. EunHa bit her lips before straightening up. As he watched her cat-like eyes slowly lift up and blink, he spoke in a businesslike tone.
“Do you know what kind of company we are?”

“I heard about it plenty of times when I was in training.”

KyungHyun opened the file that the general manager had sent him and clicked it open. He blankly stared at the computer monitor and his eyes narrowed as he focused on what he saw. After finishing high school in the United States, she went to a college in the same state and graduated. Her parents passed away 10 years ago in an accident. Nothing unusual was on her resume. She graduated at the top of her class.
KyungHyun’s eyes were glued to one part of the monitor. 10 year ago.
Death by accident.



Something popped into his head. KyungHyun frowned.
“…Your specs are very impressive.”

His monotonous voice murmured. EunHa wasn’t sure whether he was complimenting her or not. His long fingers went up to his chin as if by habit. His black eyes darkened as they roamed over her. There was nothing wrong with her resume and her posture showed her confidence.
‘What is it?’

EunHa blinked quickly. She felt as if the temperature in the room had cooled. Was she just imagining it? She slightly nodded her head.
“Thank you.”

“Why did you apply to our company? With this resume, you could have gotten into any company you wanted.”
“There’s something I want to accomplish here.” “And what is that?”
At his curt question, EunHa looked into his narrow eyes and answered.
“…I’ll only tell you if you promise not to fire me.”

“I can find out on my own by going through your interview notes.”
“You won’t be able to tell whether I answered truthfully or whether I only said what the interviewer wanted to hear.”
He stared at her for a while before standing up and walking towards her. The only thought in her head was about how handsome he looked even when he frowned. His shirt emphasized his broad shoulders, and his vest and suit jacket made him look like he’d just



come out of a men’s fashion magazine.

His amazing physique was hidden under the suit, but she felt that this was the most handsome she’d seen him. She didn’t feel this much pressure back when she met him at the squash courts. But having met him now on his turf, the company known as YongSung, she felt that he could kill somebody with one look. EunHa kept her head up with much difficulty and spoke in a clear voice.
“I can do the job well. Please give me any task you wish.” “…Only time will tell whether you can do the job well or
not.”

KyungHyun’s voice lowered again. He cocked his head. EunHa was taller than the average woman, and she was even wearing high heels. Still, KyungHyun was taller than her, so he looked down at her while he spoke. At almost 190 cm, he was taller than any of the men she had seen at Serim. EunHa swallowed, her mouth dry. She looked straight at him. She mustn’t avoid his gaze. She mustn’t lose.
“I think there is one crucial problem with having you enter this company, Lee HaEun-ssi.”
He gazed at EunHa as she pretended to stay calm, and his lips stretched in to a smile. Her heart was beating so fast. Even though there was no way he knew her true identity, if she were caught, it would be the end for her. Her mouth went dry. She managed to keep her composure and asked him languidly.
“And what would that be?”

10 years ago, YongSung and Serim made a ruckus on national TV. After this scandal, these two organizations became enemies. If Shin KyungHyun realized that she was actually someone sent by Serim, he might strangle her with his large hands right here right now.
During the scandal, the media reported that there were 30 cases of



missing or dead employees. In actuality, there were more than 100 unreported cases. Trying to hide her anxiety, EunHa smiled. KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed.
“Your figure is a bit too glamorous for a secretary, Lee HaEun-ssi.”
Gulp. EunHa unconsciously swallowed. She controlled her expression and awkwardly opened her mouth. It was still too early to relax.
“It wasn’t that long ago when you told me that you preferred glamorous women.”
“That’s only when it comes to sex.”

He was now extremely close. She could feel his breaths against her forehead.
“I don’t mix business with pleasure. When a woman is in my bed, she never comes to work with me. I find it hard to focus.”
“…That’s not my fault, is it?
“You’ll find that life is quite unfair when you live long enough.”
Unlike the impression he gave off, his breaths were warm. He must normally have a high body temperature. This thought popped into EunHa’s head as she drawled her response.
“You’re a picky boss, aren’t you, Director Shin KyungHyun- nim?”
“Yes. So quit now while you can.”

He spoke as if he was giving her a last chance. EunHa blinked her



eyes charmingly.

“It doesn’t look like that’s the only reason you want me to quit. Am I wrong?”
“No. Good catch.”

EunHa lowered her full eyelashes and softly whispered.

“I will be good, sir.” “Your eyes.”
She had deliberately lowered her eyes, but when she heard his words, she flinched and looked up. KyungHyun’s expression was cold, and his eyes were blazing. He looked at her as if he’d pierce her soul. She felt as if she was being tied down by an invisible rope. As expected, he wasn’t a man who would surrender to mere temptation.
“I noticed this the last time we met as well, but you have a bad habit of leaving important details out, Lee HaEun-ssi. Just what are you going to be good about? If you aren’t specific, aren’t you worried that I may misunderstand?”
From past experience, EunHa knew how men felt when they wanted her. Therefore it wasn’t difficult for EunHa to guess that Shin KyungHyun was worked up as he stood in front of her. She just couldn’t tell whether it was due to sexual arousal or due to a thirst for violence. Was he thirsty for sex or for the hunt? For Shin KyungHyun, the two were extremely alike.
“If you’re saying those things intentionally, then you are clearly doing this on purpose.”
EunHa felt that she couldn’t win him over by seducing him. Back at the squash court, he hadn’t shown his true self to her. He had deliberately only shown her a fraction of who he really was. EunHa now remembered that Shin KyungHyun was a level-headed



buisnessman who held a high position in the powerful organization of YongSung. They committed crimes just as terrible as the ones committed by Serim. Maybe even worse. Either way, he was just like the rest of them.
“Do you remember my answer when you asked me why I had such an intense workout?”
He took out a Zippo lighter and lit a cigarette. He slowly took a drag. His cheeks sucked in, and the cigarette glowed. His eyes narrowed behind the gray smoke. He looked at her in the same way a predator looked at its prey. EunHa swallowed, her throat dry, before speaking again.
“I remember.” “What did I say?”
“That you had a lot… piled up.” “And why was that?”
EunHa licked her dry lower lip. She stared directly at him as she replied.
“You told me that you had a lot piled up because you haven’t had sex.”
“Right. With my body in this state right now, having sex with you constantly for 2 nights and 3 days won’t be enough. I don’t want to see a woman like you running around me. I feel like shoving my dick inside you until you beg for your life with tears in your eyes.”
As expected… a leopard can’t change its spots. Those vulgar words spilled out of KyungHyun’s perfectly symmetrical lips. EunHa didn’t blink an eye when she heard those words. Even though they pierced through her ears like nails, her sweaty palms were a result of



the tension in the air.

“There’s no need to drag this out any longer. Even if you lift up your skirts and take off your panties right here, right now, it doesn’t matter. I can make it so that you won’t even be thinking about where we are when I’m finished with you.”
His long fingers approached her face. Then he used two of his fingers to brush off some dust from her hair. The smell of cigarette smoke and musk entered her nose. Even though he didn’t directly touch her, EunHa’s pale face flushed. Her mouth went dry.
“Basically, you’d be dumping this role play as my secretary and just become my woman. However, if that happens, you won’t be able to go outside without my permission. I’m a very paranoid person. I might just confine you in a place no one else knows and watch you 24 hours a day.”
His voice was terribly low. He barely opened his lips as the cigarette smoke flowed out. Then in one whoosh, the smoke disappeared into his mouth.
Normally, men didn’t smoke cigarettes like this. His cruel eyes were gazing at her. He was definitely a gangster. He was probably someone who would get rid of anyone who displeased him, even if they were women or the elderly.
“If your objective is to have sex with me once, I’m warning you now. It won’t end there. Unless I find someone else, it’ll be for eternity. If something happens to me outside and I end up dead, no one will be able to find you, and you will die with me in your room. There are many people that wish me dead. But I’m sure you know that. Because you’re quite clever, aren’t you, Lee HaEun-ssi?”
EunHa quickly calmed her heart and bit her cheek.



“If you don’t have the confidence to take your clothes off right now, get out.”
EunHa’s face was expressionless, but a silent chaos was brewing inside her eyes. KyungHyun had caught all the signals she sent his way to seduce him and was now giving her a warning. He was telling her not to cross the line. She had a hunch that many women threw themselves at him. And whenever that happened, he would set up a trap just like this.
“I want to work.”

EunHa parted her dry lips. KyungHyun glared at her with sharp eyes. She pulled herself together and repeated herself.
“I came to this company because I wanted to work here.” “……”
She took advantage of the silence and spoke more clearly.

“I will work hard not to offend you anymore, Director. I don’t want to quit on my first day of work. I also have my pride, sir.”
His lips slanted as he gazed at her. A haze of desire brushed past his eyes. Even though the silence was brief, EunHa felt as if she was suffocating.
“You’re pretty stubborn.”

KyungHyun pressed the finished cigarette in the ashtray and murmured. Even though he knew she approached him to seduce him, he was still incredibly attracted to her. How ironic. No, maybe that was why he was even more interested in her.
“I’ll do my best not to disappoint you.”



“Save me…”
For a moment, an old memory rose up in his mind. Someone’s eyes overlapped with EunHa’s eyes, leaving a bitter taste in his mouth. Why did this woman approach him? What was her purpose? KyungHyun’s languid voice broke the silence.
“Lee HaEun-ssi.” “Yes.”
He leaned back onto his desk and loosened his tie. His Adam’s apple was now visible and began to move as he spoke.
“This Friday, I am planning on meeting with Mayor Kim MinSuk.”
EunHa widened her eyes as relief spread throughout her body. For now, he wouldn’t be asking for her employee badge and kicking her out of the building.
“Yes, sir. It scheduled it in this morning. It will be taking place somewhere around Samsung-dong.”
He slowly watched EunHa’s face as he listened to her report his schedule.
“Compared to the amount of money he received from KeumOh, his results haven’t been up to par. These men just take our money and don’t even care about our requests.”
EunHa gazed at KyungHyun as he crossed his arms. She began to calculate inside her head. Today was Wednesday. And he was going to meet Kim MinSuk on Friday. That meant that there were only two days. She had two days to win him over so that he’d trust her.
“I will write a report on the private lives of Kim MinSuk and his family and present it to you as soon as possible.”



“He’s a rat bastard, so it won’t be difficult to find some dirt on him.”
“If he’s going around receiving bribes, I’m sure he’s made more than a few mistakes here and there. I will do my best.”
At EunHa’s calm response, KyungHyun nodded. He raised his eyebrows.
“This will be your first assignment as a secretary, Lee HaEun-ssi.”
“I guess I’ll have to get as much dirt on him as possible if I don’t want this to be my last.”
Hearing her declaration, the ends of KyungHyun’s lips went up slightly.
“…I’ll look forward to it.”

Exiting KyungHyun’s office, EunHa let out a breath. She hadn’t noticed the cold sweat on the back of her neck until now.
Shin KyungHyun.

The right-hand man of Noh HyungChul, the boss of YongSung. With Noh HyungChul lying in his sickbed, KyungHyun now represented the company. Inside the KeumOh building located in the heart of Gangnam, he was the brains behind all the illegal activities committed by the company.
Three days ago, when she had met him for the first time accidentally on purpose, he had an easygoing laugh and a more friendly attitude. However, it all ended up being a joke. In the world of KeumOh, which carried YongSung on its back, KyungHyun stood at the very top, and he didn’t get there by sheer luck. Even though she knew this, she had felt nervous about seeing all this with her own eyes. However, reality turned out to be more intense than expected.



During the time she spent in his office, which only lasted around 30 minutes, she felt that she was being scanned every second, every moment. Behind his eyes, which were hazy with lust, she could see a spark of suspicion. And Shin KyungHyun didn’t even try to hide it.
He let her know that he was sexually attracted to her and didn’t let it become a weakness. Instead, he was using it to overwhelm her. He didn’t hide that he would be able to pluck her head from her shoulders if she got on his nerves. EunHa unconsciously pressed the back of her hand to her cheek. They felt a bit warm. If she didn’t want to be ripped apart by the beast, she would have to stay alert at all times.
She quickly returned to her seat and turned on the computer monitor.
“That son of a bitch is a man who has already killed a bunch of people and buried them. I don’t know why Boss is sending a rookie like you, Princess. It would have been better if I was sent instead. Fuck.”
She recalled YongJoon’s words as he winced when the stitched wound on his forehead tugged when he frowned. He was telling the truth. She knew for a fact that if Shin KyungHyun found out who she really was, she would disappear from the face of the earth.
Click.

KyungHyun opened the glass door separating his office from the secretarial office. He went through the doorway with long steps.
“The president has almost arrived.”

An employee urgently spoke up in a small voice. When all the employees in the secretarial office heard that the president might arrive at headquarters at any moment, they quickly began to clean up their desks. The president of KeumOh. The boss of YongSung.



When she recalled Noh HyungChul, EunHa’s heart began to race inside her chest.
She could still recall the screams of her father. Her mother’s blood dripping down as she fell. The tears spilling from her eyes. EunHa couldn’t forget them.
EunHa closed her eyes as if out of habit. Even though the boss of YongSung was currently staying at his palatial residence, lying down like a corpse due to his chronic illness, he was surrounded by militant bodyguards at all times. And now she was currently in the middle of this impregnable man’s main headquarters. Her eyelashes trembled as she opened her eyes.
Ding.

When the elevator doors opened, KyungHyun walked into the elevator with General Manager Cha at his side. While everyone else was busily looking at their monitors underneath the partitions of the cubicles, EunHa raised her head and met KyungHyun’s eyes. As they stared at each other, EunHa faintly smiled and lowered her head.
I will use you in order to have my revenge.

She was told that this man had been active in YongSung for 8 years now. 10 years had passed since she had lost her name and became an orphan. Even though he hadn’t actively participated in her parents’ deaths, Shin KyungHyun was still a member of YongSung. Even though she had never killed anyone before, KyungHyun was supposed to be the first man she was to kill. She would just think of it as practice for when she killed YongSung’s boss later.
In order to do this, she needed to gain his trust. Not just with her body. She needed something to catch Shin KyungHun’s interest. She didn’t take her eyes off him until his blank face disappeared with the closing of the elevator doors.



TN: KyungHyun’s little speech to EunHa is HR’s ultimate nightmare.
On a more serious note, there is something I have to say. I’ve noticed that some Wattpad pages have been uploading my translations for “oﬄine viewing purposes”. While I understand the convenience of it all, please, please, PLEASE don’t do this! Wattpad is an incredibly well-known site, and as some of you know, Korean authors are known to be very aggressive when it comes to third- party translations. Because of the way Korea’s copyright system works, if they ask translators like me to take down their translations, there’s nothing we can do about it (understandable). Since Wattpad is such a high-traffic site, the likelihood of Korean authors recognizing their work becomes extremely high. If that happens, I will be taking down my translations and stop all translation projects. This is an incredibly serious matter, and I don’t want to risk anything. I have messaged the wattpad authors that I’ve noticed are uploading my translations to take them down. If they continue to stay up, I will have to figure out another way to upload my translations or stop completely.






Friday night. It was well past midnight, and the taxis were busy in the heart of the city. The neon signs illuminated the roads in a different way than the sun did during the daytime. EunHa watched the stumbling, drunk men with tired eyes. If she could have her own way, she would have lain down on the floor right this instant.
“Where is your home?”

Her boss, KyungHyun, had just returned from his meeting with the mayor of Seoul, Kim MinSuk. As he got back into the car, he asked her the short question. EunHa, who was sitting next to him, gave him her address.
After ordering the driver to turn the car around, KyungHyun kept his mouth shut. The secret meeting lasted for over two hours. EunHa was trapped inside the car until the last appointment on his schedule was completed. However, she didn’t complain or express any discomfort.
“Thank you for taking me home.”

In no time, she saw the apartment building she was staying at. He observed the simple apartment buildings before speaking in a monotone voice.
“I’ll see you next week at the office.” “Yes, sir. Please take care.”
“Good work today.”

The moment EunHa’s hand touched the door handle, she heard



him softly mutter those words. She curtly nodded before opening the door and exiting the car. As her high heels clacked on the pavement, her figure looked upright and tidy.
KyungHyun recalled how she had knocked on his office door that morning. After ordering EunHa to secretly investigate Kim MinSuk, KyungHyun ignored her for two days and treated her if she were invisible. After taking a good look at her face for the first time in two days, he noticed that she looked quite tired.
“What is this?”

The first page of the report that EunHa had turned in was related to Kim MinSuk’s youngest son who was diagnosed with epilepsy. EunHa had also included a record of the travel logs of Kim MinSuk’s wife for the past 10 years. He didn’t know how she had managed to get her hands on this information. KyungHyun read through the report carefully, and his sharp eyes narrowed.
“…Mostly the Netherlands.”

“Yes, sir. She left for the Netherlands multiple times with her son, but she’s also gone there alone. As you know, the Netherlands is a country where cannabidiol is legal.”
Cannabidiol (CBD). It was a hemp extract that was reported to be an effective treatment for symptoms of epilepsy or Alzheimer’s. The hemp oil was administered orally, and would decrease the epileptic seizures. However, in South Korea, it was considered a psychoactive drug and was therefore illegal to use.
“You are also aware that an assemblyman affiliated with Kim MinSuk recently proposed the legalization of hemp for medical purposes to the National Assembly, right?”
“This information isn’t enough to prove that Kim MinSuk’s wife has been using hemp to treat her son’s symptoms.”



“But it still gives a strong sense of probability.”

“Even if this was proven to be true, the fact that he was doing this for his sick son will probably gain him some sympathy points from the voters. People love emotional dramas.”
Since this was his first offense, his sentencing wouldn’t be harsh. KyungHyun looked at her as he shook his head. However, EunHa merely shrugged.
“Well, you’re probably right about that. But, Director, there’s more on the back of the page.”
He didn’t think there was more to the report. He blankly looked up at her before turning the page. His face suddenly hardened. It was a photograph taken in a suite room of an expensive hotel. In the picture, many people dressed in fancy clothing were sprawled out all over the place.
“Over here. The kid on the sofa is Kim MinSuk’s oldest son. He’s now twenty years old, and he’s as rowdy as they come.”
The dazed people in the smoky room were obviously high. Their eyes were dilated, and bottles of whisky and champagne were scattered all over the chaotic room.
“How did you get ahold of this?” “What do you mean? I met the kid at a club and followed him here. Thanks to him, I stayed up all night before coming in for work. I thought I’d die of exhaustion.”
As she obviously expressed her displeasure at all the trouble she had to go through, the ends of KyungHyun’s lips slightly moved up before quickly returning to its usual grim line.
“It looks like General Manager Cha didn’t hire you just for your face.” “Is that a compliment, sir?”



EunHa nodded indifferently before raising her index finger.

“Anyways, this kid was born with a silver spoon and really wanted to pursue music. However, since his father wasn’t merely a rich man but a rich politician, he wasn’t able to act as he wished in public. Therefore, he began to steal some of his younger brother’s medicine to pass the time. Even his mother couldn’t stop him.”
“Did he tell you all this himself?” “No. It’s just my guess.” “What?”
Gazing at KyungHyun’s confused expression, EunHa’s eyes sparkled as if she had just found a fun toy to play with.
“People may like emotional dramas, but they go crazy for soap operas.”
KyungHyun had only ordered her to find some dirt on Kim MinSuk. However, she’d gone a step further and made a crack instead. EunHa raised both of her hands to her chest and pressed them together as if she were praying. She tilted her head down and looked at him as she whispered, her face full of confidence.
“Wouldn’t it be fun if I scheduled an interview with a third- rate gossip magazine and leaked this information?” “His political career won’t end with this kind of scandal.” “He’s still going to have to step down as mayor, don’t you think? He was planning on running as a presidential candidate for the next term, so he probably doesn’t want any tongues to wag about something like this.”
Recalling her face as she replied so brazenly, KyungHyun laughed silently. He raised his large hand and rubbed his face. He was tired.



During their dinner, Kim MinSuk behaved as predicted. He avoided KyungHyun’s demands by claiming they were too risky. It seemed like he was only thinking of how to deflect KyungHyun by using this excuse over and over again.
“We haven’t seen each other in a long time. Why don’t we just spend this time having a few drinks together? Is the president still feeling unwell?”
KyungHyun watched him order another bottle of liquor and took out a cigarette. There was hemp in the cigarette, and as the smoke began to spread throughout the room, Kim MinSuk finally realized what was going on. His expression stiffened as he frowned.
“Just what do you think you’re doing in front of me?” “I heard that you’ve done some good for your party recently. I believe you can give KeumOh any future business you may have. I will personally see to it that you get anything you need.” “Director Shin, are you joking around with me?”
Kim MinSuk swallowed some liquor as he glared at KyungHyun over his glasses. No matter how much KeumOh had developed as a company, it still had its roots in the mob. Therefore, affiliating oneself with a company like them was basically political suicide.
“I heard that you’ve run into some trouble thanks to your son, so I was only thinking about how to help you out with that.”
As KyungHyun took a deep drag of the cigarette, Kim MinSuk glared at him, his mouth twisted. His cold voice was full of rage as it shattered the silence in the room.
“Even if that is the case, it isn’t right to speak of a sick child like that. Director Shin, it seems that I’ve been mistaken about you.” “It doesn’t matter to me how you used to see me.” “What did you say?” “I was only wondering if



your oldest son was also sick. Is that why he’s been doing drugs?”
At the words that left KyungHyun’s mouth, Kim MinSuk lost his composure.
“Well, I’m sure the doctor will be the judge of that. If he is diagnosed with extreme depression by a psychiatric clinic, I’m sure there might be some gossip, but it shouldn’t matter. I’m sure it’ll also help him get out of his military service.”
“S-see here, Director Shin.”

It was smooth sailing from there on out. KyungHyun watched as Kim MinSuk’s face reddened and smiled comfortingly.
“They say the hardest thing to do in the world is raising your kids. It seems that those words ring true. Let me pour you a glass of liquor. Like you said, we came out here to comfortably share a few drinks.”
After that, the conversation with Kim MinSuk flowed naturally. His behavior suddenly changed, and it was all partly thanks to Lee EunHa. However, KyungHyun still wasn’t sure whether his decision to keep her was the right one or not.
“Should we leave now, Director?”

Waiting for his order, the driver cautiously asked. KyungHyun’s elbow was leaning on the window as his hand held his chin. He was lost in thought as he shook his head.
“Let’s wait here for a while longer.”

“Yes, sir. That thing you asked us to prepare has just finished.”
“Give it to me.”



The driver handed him a small earphone. KyungHyun put it into his ear and looked out the window as he lit a cigarette. EunHa’s perfume was still lingering inside the car. Even as the heavy smoke filled his lungs, KyungHyun felt as if her smell still lingered at the tip of his nose.
When EunHa opened the door and entered her apartment, she almost let out a shriek. However, she managed to suppress it as she grit her teeth.
“What do you think you’re doing?”

YongJoon’s large body was stretched out on top of her bed. When she entered, he got up and began to pick his ears.
“Why are you coming home so late? Have you fucked Shin KyungHyun already?”
“Why are you here? Have you completely lost your mind?”

No matter how stupid he was, this was ridiculous. EunHa quickly ran to the window and lowered the blinds. Even though it was impossible for someone to look into her apartment on the 20th floor, she couldn’t be too sure.
“Take a good look at what I’m wearing. You think I’m retarded, don’t you? I know better than to just walk in.”
EunHa shrugged and looked YongJoon up and down. He was wearing the uniform of a well-known pizza chain. He was also wearing a cap. Not wearing his usual suit, YongJoon did look younger. But he couldn’t hide his face, which still made him look like a thug. As he reached into his pocket to take out a pack of cigarettes, YongJoon drew in a breath. It seemed that his wound from SungHo hadn’t completely healed yet.
“Get out right now. Carefully, so that no one notices you.”



EunHa snatched his cigarette and broke it in half before tossing it into the trash bin.
“Hey, do you wanna die?”

Having lost the wind in his sails, YongJoon barked out.

“If you have nothing important to say, listen to your noona and get lost.”
“Aigoo, I just might…”

He raised his hand as if he was going to hit her. However, he held back and didn’t touch her. He had been expelled before he could graduate middle school and began working as an underling at Serim ever since. Even though he had made it all the way up to his position now, he was still one year younger than EunHa.
Even though he didn’t show it, he had a complex about his young age. EunHa knew this and constantly pushed his buttons, so he wanted to give her a good, proper punch. But since he couldn’t do that, he was incredibly frustrated.
“Hey, you. Why did you turn off the bug we planted? Do you know how frustrated I was all day wondering if something went wrong?”
EunHa scoffed, taken aback.

“Do you think YongSung was born yesterday?”

“It’s dangerous, so I’m telling you to wear it whenever you leave your apartment.”
EunHa walked over to the end table next to her bed and opened the drawer. She took out a ballpoint pen that served as a wireless bug. Then she fiercely threw it at YongJoon. The long pen hit his chest and fell onto the floor.



“If I walk around with this kind of thing on me and get caught, I’ll die a dog’s death. But I’m sure you’d enjoy hearing my death live, wouldn’t you?”
EunHa spoke sarcastically, and YongJoon’s bushy eyebrows went up as he fumed. His dark face flushed.
“Fuck, who said we’d leave you like that? You think we’re morons, don’t you?”
EunHa shook her head as she threw her purse on the table.

“If that’s all, get lost. Make sure no one sees you. You’re the one who is putting me in a dangerous situation right now by being here. You’ve heard of the saying ‘If your head is bad, then your body will suffer’, right? I feel that I won’t be able to die a peaceful death if you’re standing around next to me.”
She opened the fridge and took out a cold can of beer. YongJoon watched her, his breaths puffing in anger.
“Hey. Is that what you say to someone who was only worried about you…”
EunHa opened the can and took a sip of the fizzling beer. She then went over to the bed and ripped off the hidden cellphone taped underneath the bed. The phone rang for a moment before SungHo answered the call.
“Ahjussi, it’s me.”

YongJoon flinched when he realized she was speaking to SungHo. His hand reflexively went to his arm. Ignoring him, EunHa brought the phone closer to her ear and perched on the bed.
“He met Kim MinSuk for two hours, and no money was exchanged. Judging from Shin KyungHyun’s reaction, the



threat seemed to have worked.”
⦁	Why did the two of them meet?
SungHo asked curtly. EunHa took another sip of the beer before lightly nibbling on the top edge of the can.
“The employees of the secretarial office only organize the schedule and fulfill orders given from above. Important files are protected by a password, so only people like Shin KyungHyun or higher have access to them. And that brainless general manager who always follows Shin KyungHyun around is completely in his corner, so I don’t think we’ll be able to get anything out of him.”
⦁	Is that all?
EunHa began to shake her folded legs in frustration as she answered.
“His reputation is exactly what the report stated. He’s a man who is very suspicious in nature and doesn’t leave anyone to their own devices. He goes swimming or plays some squash in the mornings to exercise. When he comes in to the office, he doesn’t even leave the building until the day is over. I’ve been watching him for two weeks straight, and his routine never changes. Even when he leaves work, his days seem scheduled. He may meet various people throughout the day, but the only person that accompanies him is his driver.”
⦁	So in the end, you’re telling me that you don’t know the reason why he met Kim MinSuk.
Sungo replied bluntly. EunHa slightly frowned.

“Doesn’t everyone know that Kim MinSuk is the father-in- law of the Attorney General? It’s obvious that they want the



support of the prosecutors. In order to have it, they laundered money and supported his political career, but all he’s done is take the money and give nothing in return. I’m sure he went out of touch once the election was over.”
SungHo listened silently as EunHa spoke.

“Additionally, Shin KyungHyun’s date of departure has been set.”
⦁	When is it?
“It’s in 6 weeks, but I think he’ll only be taking those that are close to him. Like you said, if any information is leaked, they’ll be in big trouble…”
⦁	Once you’re able to join him, let me know.
SungHo cut off her words. He was telling her to use whatever means necessary to accompany him on that trip. Thanks to all the big and small incidents at Serim, EunHa knew very well that SungHo’s intuition had become sharp. The main source of income for the organization was black-market dealings, but they had already been caught by the police multiple times. Therefore, Serim needed to find another source of revenue.
SungHo wasn’t going to miss this opportunity to make money through stock manipulation. He had already bought a large chunk of the stocks of a failing pharmaceutical company. He had bought these stocks for almost nothing and was planning on snatching the project Shin KyungHyun was currently developing. Once SungHo increased the value of the stocks in his possession, he was going to sell them for hundreds of billions of won and make an enormous profit.
“Alright. And until I ask for it, please don’t send people to check on me. Shin KyungHyun is too observant. He’ll definitely catch on that something is going on.”



She didn’t tell SungHo that she had already tried to follow Shin KyungHyun several times but was shaken off every time. She was afraid that SungHo would order her to pull out of this mission if she told him.
“I don’t know how much marijuana he smoked when he met up with Kim MinSuk, but when he got back inside the car, he reeked of it.”
⦁	So?
“He didn’t look dazed at all and seemed perfectly normal.”

Nine out of ten times, people who smoked marijuana would become lethargic and relaxed. However, Shin KyungHyun acted as he normally did with EunHa. His normally low voice only sounded a bit lower, but that was it. She felt that if he was the type to enjoy drug abuse, she could have taken advantage of it and seduced him. However, she didn’t think she’d be able to do that with KyungHyun.
⦁	He’s never been an easy man.
SungHo scoffed as his thin voice rang through the phone. EunHa quickly responded.
“Yes. That’s why I don’t think I should install the wiretapping devices around him. Even though this isn’t an airport, whenever we scan our employee ID’s, there’s a machine that takes a full body scan before we enter the offices. This even applies to all the security guards and janitors that enter the building. If I bring something suspicious inside, I’ll be taken away before I can even install it.”
⦁	Do whatever you see fit. How will I get in contact you?
“I probably won’t be available for contact very often. I’ll try to talk to you at least once a week.”



⦁	… Have you slept with Shin KyungHyun yet?
EunHa was just about to hang up the phone when she froze.

“Not yet.”

She could hear SungHo light a cigarette on the other end. She heard him blow out the smoke before he spoke up.
⦁	That’s so unlike you. What’s the reason for dragging this out?… Are you acting virginal in order to seduce him this time? A rag won’t become a towel just because it has been washed.”
EunHa frowned and began to laugh silently. Sex was often an absolutely necessity when it came to extracting information from a target. EunHa was the one who usually seduced a man into bed and then stole from him while he was asleep. Even though SungHo knew this very well, he always framed her as a whore.
After her parents passed away, she had nowhere to go. The one who came and held her hand during this moment of vulnerability was SungHo. However, she had to do whatever he ordered her to do as payment. One could call this a win-win relationship.
There was no other place that was more secure and effective than Serim when it came to having her revenge on those that killed her parents. As a puff of laughter escaped her lips, SunHo spoke up sharply.
⦁	Why are you laughing?
“Because you’re too funny, Ahjussi.”

Even though SungHo always treated her like a whore, he had never actually had sex with her. After a round of dry-humping, he would always call for a prostitute and lounge around like a king in his harem. Then he ordered EunHa to stay by his side and watch. His strange preferences were laughable to her.



⦁	Lee EunHa.
There was a trace of malice in SungHo’s voice. He would definitely have taken out his knife and held it up to her if he were standing in front of her. Even if he were to cut off a part of her body, he wouldn’t be able to kill her. This was because Kang SungHo was a perverse man who enjoyed toying with her life in his hands.
SungHo didn’t sexually desire her. Sexual desire was just an illusion that made one think that they completely possessed another person. Whatever it was that he felt for her, she didn’t care.
“You’re the one who told me not to act like a whore in front of him because he’s a difficult man, Ahjussi.”
EunHa spoke, her voice full of charm. SungHo’s voice remained hard.
⦁	And you’re not the type of girl to fall for a good-looking guy like Shin KyungHyun.
“I don’t want to explain my methods to you. Let’s call it my business secret. Well, I guess it doesn’t matter since I learned it all from you, Ahjussi.”
SungHo chuckled softly, and his voice finally sounded like it had softened as it rang through the phone.
⦁	Be careful. Don’t trust that bastard.
EunHa crinkled the half-full beer can and scoffed.

“You might as well tell me to trust any son of a bitch I pass by on the streets.”
You son of a bitch, perverted bastard.

EunHa thought to herself and hung up the phone. In front of her, a



nervous YongJoon was standing still, his breathing silent. It seemed that he hadn’t reported to SungHo about entering her apartment.
It made sense. SungHo would never have ordered him to do something so dangerous. EunHa went over to her wardrobe and began to take out her pajamas. She glanced over at YongJoon.
“Aren’t you leaving?”

Tick, tick. EunHa undid the buttons on her blouse and her breasts in her half cup bra spilled out. YongJoon chewed on his dry lips and let out a curse.
“You fucking… crazy… bitch. Do you take off your clothes in front of anyone?”
As his the words left his lips, EunHa completely took off her blouse and tossed it into the laundry basket. She was now only wearing her bra and her skirt. As YongJoon’s breaths became heavier, EunHa slowly walked over to him and stood right in front of him.
“Why? Are you so aroused that you can’t control yourself?” “Fuck…”
“Do you want Noona to suck you over here?”

Her hand lightly brushed over the hard bulge in his pants. Even though he was wearing jeans, her touch was enough to stimulate him. YongJoon flinched.
His large hands roughly grabbed her hair. EunHa’s sharp chin shot up into the air, but she didn’t make a sound. She was definitely a spiteful woman. YongJoon frowned and spoke, his voice tight.
“You bitch… Where’s the woman who cracked my forehead for taking a peek at her panties? You’re toying with me now…”



“I wasn’t able to fuck Shin KyungHyun today, so I’m very wet right now. If I close my eyes, I won’t have to see your ugly face. I think it’ll work if I just imagine it’s him.”
“What did you say?”

With his long hair covering his face, YongJoon gloomily stood there like a ghost. He no longer looked like a seventeen-year-old. YongJoon’s breaths became heavy, and EunHa’s lips went up into a pout.
“What? You don’t want to be a substitute? Whatever, that’s fine.”
“…Suck it right now, you bitch.”

Even though he felt humiliated, YongJoon’s face was flushed with arousal. EunHa watched as he hurriedly began to undo his belt. She began to chuckle. A strange, scary gleam flashed across her sparkling eyes.
“But you know, YongJoon.” “…Haa…”
“Did you know that I can bite off your dick as I suck it?” “……”
“If you want to take that risk, take your pants off.” “Wh-what?”
He was in the middle of hastily trying to take out his erection from his underwear when he froze. A mix of emotions flashed across YongJoon’s eyes all at once.
“Isn’t it worth taking the risk? There’s a thrill. This might be the first time we have sex as well as the last. You’re



presenting your dick to me because you’re prepared to become a eunuch, right?”
As he looked into EunHa’s eyes filled with madness, YongJoon knew very well that she was dangerous enough to actually go through with it. Her lips stained with red lipstick now looked terrifying to him.
“Whatever. Get lost, you crazy bitch.”

YongJoon let go of his grip on her hair and quickly pulled his pants back up as he caught his breath. Just the thought of having his penis ripped off by her caused cold sweat to form on the back of his neck.
“Pity. I wanted to enjoy it, too. Well, if you don’t want to…”

EunHa flashed her white teeth as she chuckled prettily. She turned around and unhooked her bra. YongJoon quickly closed his eyes. EunHa heard the front door of the apartment open and close with a thud. EunHa snickered and continued to take off her clothes. They fell off her body like a second skin. Then she slowly made her way to the bathroom.
Whoosh.

EunHa turned on the hot water and became lost in thought as she went over the day’s events. She recalled the way they stood next to each other as they spoke in his office. Her body immediately flushed at the memory. EunHa raised her head and let the water fall on her face.
“Haa…”

Shin KyungHyun’s strangely competitive nature had the strange ability to arouse people. His bottomless, black eyes seemed to hold so many thoughts. EunHa chuckled and put some body wash on her bath sponge before slowly rubbing her body.





Fresh out of a long bath, EunHa’s face was flushed as she stepped out of the bathroom. She went over to her bed and laid down. She noticed then that she had two missed calls. Two calls within 20 minutes. EunHa quickly called the number back. Shortly, the voice that had been bothering her all night answered the call.
– Shin KyungHyun speaking.
“This is Lee Eun…”

She was about to say her real name by accident but bit her lips before she could finish her sentence.
“This is Lee HaEun. Did you call?”

She’d never made a mistake like this before, so her heart was racing. KyungHyun drawled his answer.
– I just wanted to make sure that you got home okay. “You dropped me off in front of my apartment.” “But I didn’t see you close your door.”
“Then you should just walk me to my door next time.”

She faintly heard KyungHyun’s breaths. She could imagine him laughing silently on the other end.
“Why are you laughing?”



⦁	I don’t have the confidence to take you to your door and return to my car without doing anything, Lee EunHa-ssi.
“… What am I supposed to say at times like this?”
⦁	You can say whatever you want. Isn’t that your specialty?
KyungHyun’s voice was low. She didn’t hear anything else in the background. Suddenly, she heard a faint clanking noise. It sounded like he was drinking liquor, and the ice was bumping against the glass. It was one in the morning right now.
Even though she was the one who called him, she didn’t hate the fact that they were talking this late at night. One’s hidden desires always revealed themselves in the dark of night. Even if she was seeing a different side of him at night, there was no need to be scared. EunHa’s voice softened and sounded bewitching.
“Do you always act like this to all the secretaries, Director?”
⦁	Act like what?
“Calling a mere secretary to ask if she made it home okay.”
⦁	It’s inevitable for those around me to have tiring days. Some of them may even come across some danger.
“Aah.”

EunHa was going to sweetly whisper her thanks, but KyungHyun spoke up before she had the chance.
⦁	For example, someone might approach you at your apartment and try to get to me through you.
EunHa’s lips were open as she was about to reply. Her big eyes blinked. Even though it was impossible, it almost felt like he knew



that YongJoon had come to her apartment that night. Her body suddenly tensed up and her heart began to race.
⦁	But this is the first time I’ve ever called someone personally. I usually send someone to make sure my employees are doing well.
“……”
⦁	So in regards to your question on whether I treat all the secretaries like this, my answer is ‘no.’
EunHa bit her cheek and took a deep, silent breath. Even though KyungHyun’s voice sounded as if he was seducing her, he was calm. Almost as if he were testing her. He was definitely not high on drugs.
⦁	Why didn’t you answer my calls?
“… I was taking a shower.”
⦁	You must be the type that takes long showers. I called you twice in 20 minutes.
“Yes, sir. And after I finish my shower, I’m the type that comfortably goes to bed without putting on any clothes.”
EunHa wanted to change the subject. Her attempt wasn’t made in vain. KyungHyun laughed softly. She heard the sound of the ice clanking against his glass. He was taking a sip of his drink.
⦁	Even now?
“Of course.”
⦁	I’d like to see that.
His low voice drawled into her ear. EunHa swallowed, her mouth dry. She put her cellphone in her other hand. The hand that had been holding her phone was now damp with sweat.



“If you were only calling to check on my safety, can we hang up now?”
⦁	Go ahead.
The call didn’t end. It was as if they were both daring the other to hang up first. The silence lingered. EunHa could have ended the call first, but she didn’t. This was because she felt that he was hesitating about something as he remained silent. She was counting to five to keep her mind off the awkward silence when KyungHyun spoke up.
⦁	I apologize for underestimating you, Secretary Lee. To be honest, that’s why I called.
“Just because someone has a pretty face doesn’t mean they can’t do a good job.”
KyungHyun didn’t say anything back. EunHa chuckled softly.

“I was only joking. If you don’t say anything, it makes things awkward.”
⦁	It was the truth, so I had nothing to say.
“… That’s a compliment, right?”
⦁	Why do you ask?
“I was wondering if you were going to fire me for being pretty.”
KyungHyun laughed slowly.
⦁	I was wondering whether I should fire you or not just now. Was I caught?
“If you’re really planning on firing me, you wouldn’t be wondering about it.”



⦁	I can’t think of anything to say to that. My head hurts.
His languid voice sounded as if he were talking to himself. Before this conversation got any longer and before Shin KyungHyun had another chance to veer the conversation into unwanted territory, EunHa politely spoke.
“… I’ll bring a variety of pain relievers when I come in tomorrow. I’ll see you at the office, sir.”
EunHa quickly ended the call. She turned off the lights and got into bed. Then she pulled the covers up and covered her head. The remedy for a restless mind was sleep. Just thinking about all the things she had left to do made her feel muddled. As Shin KyungHyun continued to test her, she could feel herself waver. If she wanted to properly accomplish her goal, she couldn’t dwell on all the restless thoughts going through her mind.
EunHa tossed and turned before her breaths finally softened and she fell asleep. The car that was parked in front of EunHa’s apartment this whole time finally turned its engine on and disappeared into the night.
“Haaa…”

Inside a desolate, large hotel room, KyungHyun was sitting on a wide couch, completely naked. His hand was moving. His cock was sticking straight up like a rod as the blood rushed to it. He felt a tingling sensation travel down his penis and reach the base of his scrotum.
He was incredibly tired after today and was planning on shutting his eyes as soon as he reached his hotel room. However, the image of Lee Eunha didn’t leave his foggy mind. It had been a long time since he felt such a strong surge of desire.
“I wasn’t able to fuck Shin KyungHyun today, so I’m very



wet right now. If I close my eyes, I won’t have to see your ugly face. I think it’ll work if I just imagine it’s him.”
He had heard her venomous voice through the bug he had hidden inside her fire alarm. When he heard her words, he almost burst out of the car and headed straight to her apartment. If she really planned on having sex with someone else and he had to hear it, he wouldn’t have been able to stand it.
“Save me…”

Trying to keep her breaths silent, a young girl whispered as tears dripped from her eyes. That young girl was no longer there. EunHa was now an adult. She was like a flower that was now freely giving off its fragrance. She made people want to go easy on her, but she was a flower that was hiding its sharp thorns of poison underneath its beauty.
Lee EunHa had grown up so perfectly that it almost made one forget the trembling young girl she used to be. It wasn’t a surprise that he couldn’t recognize her when he first met her. KyungHyun laughed at himself for not realizing it.
The movement of his hands became rough, and the noises coming from the couch were getting louder. The head of his penis repeatedly appeared and disappeared into his hand. Sticky fluids spurt out from the tip and drenched his hand before dripping onto the floor.
⦁	And after I finish my shower, I’m the type that comfortably goes to bed without putting on any clothes.
The moment he pictured her sleeping on top of her sheets naked, his suppressed desire lurched and burst out of him. After ejaculating on top of his discarded clothing a few times, he sucked in a deep breath. His trembling body calmed, and he laughed bitterly to himself.



‘… Just what is she up to?’
One week ago, he noticed that somebody was following him. He thought this was strange, but he didn’t think anything of it. He was always being followed.
The same went for when he met her at the squash courts. Her bare face seemed strangely familiar to him, but he couldn’t quite remember who she was. She was just too different.
However, when he met her at the office, he knew for sure. Something strange was going on. When he saw that her parents had passed away in an accident, the old memories slammed into his head like a hammer.
Lee HaEun.

Lee EunHa.

The obvious evidence had slipped right past his nose. After the incident 10 years ago, Lee EunHa was sent to a relative’s house in the suburbs of Seoul. Not long after that, while she was on her way home from school, she went missing. That was the last he heard of her. He believed that Lee EunHa was dead.
“You’re the one who told me not to act like a whore in front of him because he’s a difficult man, Ahjussi.”
He was glad he had installed the bug inside her empty home. Thanks to that, he was able to find out that she had been raised as member of Serim by SungHo. This was a piece of information he hadn’t known until now.
Click.

KyungHyun took a cigarette out of its box and took a long drag. The thoughts inside his head were too heavy to be called a simple musing. Should he have paid more attention back then? These



regrets were useless now. These events happened long in the past. KyungHyun leaned his head back as he stretched out on the sofa. Suddenly, the hotel phone on the table rang. KyungHyun stretched out his hand and picked up the receiver.
“Hello?”

“You’ve received a call from the Chicolson Company. Would you like me to connect you to them?”
The hotel employee from the front desk spoke in a polite tone.

“Please do.”

He heard the phone ring for a few moments before the call was connected.
⦁	It’s me.
“I was planning on calling you soon, sir.”
⦁	Instead of waiting for a call from a busy man, it’s better for the man with more time to call.
“Is there something you’d like to discuss with me?”
⦁	Not really. Thanks to your hard work, Director Shin, things are looking very good on my end.
At the other end, a rough, thin voice rang through the phone.
⦁	You work too hard, Director Shin. Sometimes I really feel like I’m actually talking to a man at YongSung. I get confused at times. This is all because of how amazing you are. Isn’t that right, KyungHyun?
The trace scent of grass permeated from the cigarette as he took another drag. In one breath, a third of the cigarette turned into gray ash. While his body was becoming more relaxed with each puff, his mind was still as alert as ever.



“Then please let me return as soon as possible, sir.”
⦁	You want to come back?
SungHo’s voice was full of meaning as he tried to get a feel for what KyungHyun was thinking.
“Of course I do.”
⦁	Your speech has gotten a lot cockier lately, dear Director Shin.
“It’s because with each passing year, I’m always wondering whether I’ll be able to return or whether I’ll continue to be stuck over here. I think I’m getting old, sir.”
⦁	You shouldn’t say things like that when you still have so much work to do.
SungHo lightly clicked his tongue and laughed.
⦁	Everything doesn’t always go as planned. There are too many variables in life.
KyungHyun silently took another drag of his cigarette. He heard the sound of a lighter clicking on the other end. SungHo had an old habit of clicking the lighter on and off while he was smoking.
⦁	Once this project is finished, you can come back with a light heart. This is truly the last one.
KyungHyun’s sculpted lips tilted into a fierce smile. His eyes narrowed sharply.
⦁	Why aren’t you saying anything?
“Are you being serious, sir?”
⦁	Yeah. Your position in Serim has been prepared, so just finish things up well.


KyungHyun furrowed his brow. His cigarette had burnt up to the filter. His mind got heavier, but his body felt lighter.
“I will do my best, sir. I want to quickly return to my rightful place. I can barely stand it.”
⦁	Alright. I trust you.
Despite his words, SungHo’s voice sounded suspicious. “I will also continue to trust in you, Boss.” SungHo probably interpreted his voice in the same way.
⦁	Nothing else is new, right? Are there any rat bastards hanging
around you?

KyungHyun crushed his cigarette onto the ashtray as he responded.
“There aren’t any rat bastards, but…”

Seeing that SungHo remained silent, KyungHyun slowly spoke.

“There’s something strange.”
⦁	What is it?
“I might just be mistaken. I’ll keep my eye on it a while longer before telling you, sir. I don’t want you to worry over nothing.”
SungHo carefully chose his words before speaking.
⦁	Alright. I know how careful you are, Director Shin.
“Yes, sir. Please rest. It’s not good if the conversation stretches out any longer.”



After telling SungHo that he’d call him back later, SungHo ended the call. A silence settled over the hotel room once again. KyungHyun rested his elbow on the back of the sofa and began to massage his temple. KyungHyun focused his dazed eyes and twitched his finger.
It had been 8 years since he entered YongSung while keeping his true identity hidden. This wasn’t the first time SungHo had sent someone to keep an eye on him. Every time he did, KyungHyun tricked them perfectly. He acted as if he didn’t know when he actually did. Every time a member of Serim came to dig up any weakness he may have, he made sure never to show them a chink in his armor.
SungHo was a cunning and nasty man. He was constantly suspicious of KyungHyun, and KyungHyun worked hard to try and placate that suspicion.
⦁	Once this project is finished, you can come back with a light heart. This is truly the last one.
KyungHyun’s face turned cold. SungHo’s words, ‘the last one,’ pounded inside his head.
⦁	Your speech has gotten a lot cockier lately, dear Director Shin.
That was Kang SungHo’s truth. KyungHyun wasn’t stupid. He understood the meaning behind SungHo’s joking words. SungHo’s distrust in KyungHyun had finally reached its limit.
KyungHyun got up from his seat and slowly walked towards the bathroom. He turned the sink faucet and watched the stream of water fall for a long while. Then he splashed some water on his face. Because he had carelessly rubbed one out, his clothes were now ruined. Therefore, he didn’t put his clothes back on and was still in the nude. The cold water trickled down his body.
After washing his face with water a few more times, he looked up



at his reflection in the mirror. The twisted face of an unfamiliar man glared back at him.
After Serim’s boss passed away, SungHo took over. The first thing he did as the new boss was start the business in order to stabilize the organization. However, there was a limit to his influence if he only dealt in prostitution, real estate fraud, and drug trafficking. On top of that, the new drug enforcement organization in China had sniffed them out multiple times, causing him to lose a lot of business.
All the trustworthy members of the organization were arrested, and SungHo was backed into a corner. Therefore, he made the difficult decision of sending a young but intelligent rookie as a spy to YongSung. This rookie was KyungHyun. This was because there was no other person SungHo could send other than KyungHyun, the new member who was working hard to earn the organization’s trust.
At the time, YongSung had entered the political circles and was manipulating its stocks that way. It was on a whole different level than Serim. KyungHyun entered YongSung and fulfilled his assignment perfectly. Having done well in the field, he even caught the eye of YongSung’s boss, HyungChul, within the span of 2 years.
As he continued to lurk within YongSung, KyungHyun found out about HyungChul’s right-hand man’s schemes. This was the finishing blow. It wasn’t difficult to spot the corruption within YongSung since he had already witnessed similar corruption in Serim. On behalf of HyungChul, KyungHyun stabbed a knife into the right-hand man’s back and, in doing so, obtained the confidence of the boss.
KyungHyun siphoned off some of the funds and sent it to Serim. As the sum of money grew, SungHo was very happy with him for a few years. The problem arose when Yongsung began to give KyungHyun more and more responsibilities. The newly established company of KeumOh piggybacked the organization of YongSung. Thanks to KyungHyun’s hard work, the company grew at an incredibly fast pace. This was the only way KyungHyun was able to gain the solid



faith of his new boss without being caught.

The number of men working under KyungHyun increased each day. SungHo began to have him followed 4 years ago. Even though SungHo was beginning to dread the amount of influence KyungHyun held within YongSung, he couldn’t order him to come back to Serim. But after 8 years had passed, SungHo was suddenly telling him to return.
KyungHyun frowned. Even though SungHo ordered for his return, he sent Lee EunHa to follow him. Up until now, SungHo sent people to watch his every move. Even though Lee EunHa wouldn’t be any different, there was something strange about it this time.
Was SungHo trying to have him killed?

It wasn’t totally impossible. If the person endangering you didn’t die, then you’d die. He recalled the unwritten rule of these organizations. SungHo was afraid of KyungHyun, and he was trying to have him killed.
However, why did he send Lee EunHa of all people? Just from one look, KyungHyun could tell that she was young and inexperienced. Wouldn’t it have been more effective to send an experienced assassin and plan a sudden attack?
“Save me… Please… Please…”

He remembered the young Lee EunHa clutching the hem of his shirt as she whispered in tears, trembling in fear. The people SungHo had sent to investigate him didn’t know that he was actually a spy from Serim.
After these people returned to Serim without any results, they all disappeared quietly or were killed in a dangerous mission. This was probably all SungHo’s doing in order cover his tracks.
If KyungHyun ever recognized these people in the future, it would



put SungHo in a difficult position.

But what about Lee EunHa? How much did she know about him and Kang SungHo? The brief phone call… Because he had only heard her end of the conversation, he wasn’t able to fully understand her relationship with Kang SungHo. Even though she addressed him intimately, KyungHyun could hear the skillfully hidden chill and condescension in her voice.
A bitter laugh escaped his lips. He felt that things had become a lot more complicated than expected.
Click.

KyungHyun grabbed the bathroom cabinet and pulled the whole thing with ease. The sturdy cabinet let out a faint, metallic noise and opened. Instead of the marbled wall, a small space the size of the cabinet appeared.
After touching the screen to input his fingerprints, KyungHyun swept back his hair. In contrast to this slow movement, his voice was sharp as he spoke languidly.
“…This is Shin KyungHyun.”

The dark monitor turned on as words quickly moved across its screen.
EunHa tossed and turned in the dark. She was having a nightmare. Suddenly, her eyes burst open. It was a little past 4 AM. Her pillow and the bedsheets were completely soaked with sweat. It felt incredibly uncomfortable.
“……”

It was only a dream. Whenever she felt that the old memories from 10 years ago were fading away, they would return as nightmares. They were clearly burnt into her mind as if they had happened just



yesterday.

She opened the refrigerator door and took out a bottle of water. She downed the whole bottle in one go. Click, her hands trembled as she lit a cigarette.
“Whew…”

She opened the window and leaned out so that half her body was outside. She breathed out the smoke with a long sigh. A light sheen of water covered her face due to the drizzling rain spraying down from the sky.
Even though it was cold, it made her feel better. The weather was disgustingly sticky all afternoon, but it seemed that it was only because of the coming rain this morning.
“Huh? Mom, look! A rainbow.”

Her mother had been tending the flowers when she turned around at EunHa’s call.
“If you spray water like that against the sunlight, a rainbow will form. Isn’t that cool?” “Yeah! I wanna try too.”
Pssh, pssh. A clear rainbow appeared amidst the water particles.

“If you spray that much, you head will get wet.” “You’re so pretty, Mom.” “In my eyes, my daughter is the prettiest.”
The setting changed, and she was no longer outside the house. Her smiling mother now had blood running down her face. Collapsed on the floor, she didn’t make a sound and merely mouthed the words.
“Go…Run… EunHa, run…”

Her white nightgown was drenched in blood. Her mother had fallen down the stairs. Her breaths stopped, her eyes still open. EunHa



remembered her mother’s face so clearly as if this had all happened yesterday.
The rain dripped onto her trembling hands, and the cigarette light went out as it became damp. EunHa brought the damp ciagarette up to her lips and bit down.
“There should be a kid on the 2nd ﬂoor.” “It’s summer break, so she should still be in the house. She might have hid after hearing all the noise.”
She was about to go on a camping trip with all her friends from school in the United States. The quarterback she had a crush on from her school football team was also going to be there.
However, her parents forbade her from going, saying that it was too dangerous. She was extremely upset with them. She was already sixteen years old, and all her friends had already gone on their first dates. The fact that she was stuck at home and treated like a child was embarrassing.
So she left home in the middle of the night, holding nothing but her cellphone, and went over to her friend’s house to complain and vent. She told them how annoyed she was, how she wished her parents just disappeared.
The last words she had said to her parents were her angry shouts as she screamed at them to leave her alone. If she knew that those would be her last words to them, would it have changed anything?
EunHa looked up at the cloudy night sky and laughed. Her wish was granted. Her parents died, and now she could live her life the way she wanted to.
The tiny rain droplets became bigger. The raindrops splashed onto her cheeks and trickled down to her chin. It was still going to be a long time before the sun came up. The sky remained dark.



No star could be seen in the Seoul night sky. She occasionally saw the orange taillights of the cars crossing the Han River Bridge. In this city that never slept, nobody knew who she really was.
Sixteen. Lee EunHa basically died at that age, and she was what was left in this cloudy, dark city. If she suddenly disappeared, nobody would be sad. If she killed someone, she would be blamed and reproached. But she didn’t care.
An eye for an eye. A tooth for a tooth. She was only living her life according to Hammurabi’s code.
TN: Is it a requirement for all Korean FL’s to have a dark, tragic past? This is getting a bit ridiculous…






“Are you feeling unwell?”

KyungHyun asked EunHa in the car as they left the office. He was still looking straight ahead as he asked her. For a moment, EunHa wasn’t sure if he was talking to her. She shook her head.
“No, sir. I’m fine.”

“Your face looks thinner than usual.”

KyungHyun turned his head and looked at her. He stretched out his large hand and touched her face. Taken aback, EunHa closed her eyes and slightly pulled her head back.
“It’s not my face. It’s because your hands are too big.” “People are going to think our company starves their
employees and forces them to work.”

“I’ll take care of it.” “How?”
KyungHyun put his elbow on the car window and leaned his head on his hand as he asked. Over two weeks had passed since EunHa had become his secretary at KeumOh. After the meeting with Kim MinSuk, EunHa continued to follow KyungHyun around as he moved through his daily schedule. However, after that late night call, he only treated her as a company employee.
“How will you take care of it? Are you going to hand me a report on how you’re going to go on a strict diet to gain some



weight?”

EunHa didn’t know how to respond as her mouth opened in confusion.
“Is that what you’d like me to do?” “I’m joking.”
EunHa’s pretty brows furrowed as she smiled awkwardly. When he saw that she was looking at him pitifully, KyungHyun asked.
“Why are you looking at me like that?” “I’m only smiling because of your joke.” KyungHyun burst out laughing and blurted out. “Lee HaEun.”
“Yes, sir?”

“Do you want to share a meal with me?”

It was currently dinnertime, so this wasn’t an unusual question. Eunha tried to figure out the true intentions behind his friendly behavior and cautiously nodded her head.
“Yes, sir.”

“What kinds of food do you like?” “I like everything. I’m not picky.”
“How does Korean food sound? I like traditional Korean food.”
“Alright.”

KyungHyun ordered his driver to go to the Korean restaurant that



he frequented regularly. The driver turned the car around with ease. EunHa stared outside as her mind began to fill with thoughts.
2 weeks had already passed since she entered YongSung. Now, only one month was left before the business trip to Shenzhen, China. Two days ago, General Manager Cha had checked her passport information. This meant that there was a high possibility that she was also going to join them.
Because of this, EunHa was trying not to disturb Shin KyungHyun’s mood until then. EunHa’s mission was to go to Shenzhen and follow KyungHyun to the lab. There, she would gather data and pass it over to SungHo. SungHo would then take that data and produce an even better product from the pharmaceutical company he had bought.
Of course, there was still a huge possibility that foreign companies would refuse to buy them due to the retribution they might receive from YongSung, so stealing the new drug samples was also part of the plan. EunHa tried to glean any information about the new medical company as she worked in KeumOh, but that information was kept strictly confidential even within the company.
Other than the fact that the new medical company was located in Shenzhen, she didn’t know anything else. Having dinner with Shin KyungHyun might be a blessing or a curse. But as she wondered whether she should go through with it, the car stopped.
Tap, tap.

As they parked in the parking lot, raindrops fell onto the car window. They were definitely entering into the rainy season now. In the brief moment EunHa hesitated, the driver got out of the car and opened an umbrella. KyungHyun received the umbrella and went around the car to open the car door for EunHa.
“We’re here.”



“… Thank you.”
EunHa grabbed her purse and exited the car. The raindrops trickled down the black umbrella that KyungHyun was holding. He wasn’t asking her to share his umbrella, was he?
“Let’s go.”

As if he had read her mind, KyungHyun gestured to her with his chin, telling her to get underneath the umbrella.
“Yes, sir.”

EunHa walked carefully to avoid the raindrops, and KyungHyun matched her speed as they walked. Even though the golf umbrella that KyungHyun was holding wasn’t small by any means, it was still a tight fit due to his size. As EunHa tried to keep her distance from him, some rainwater wet her shoulder. A low voice drawled from above her head.
“If Secretary Lee continues to get wet from the rain, don’t you think that I will feel bad as the one holding the umbrella?”
“… No, I’m fine, so…”

His large hand wrapped around her shoulder and pulled her towards him. EunHa trembled as she felt the warm hand through her wet blouse. Men seemed to have higher temperatures than women. As he stuck her close to his side, KyungHyun whispered from over her head.
“Much better.”

They walked along the large road and passed through a wide yard. They then turned into a smaller road which was surrounded by acer trees. The short walk from the car to the restaurant felt long. As his hand continued to hold her to him, EunHa had no choice but to walk



in his embrace.

EunHa’s heart raced inside her chest. Was this a sign of Shin KyungHyun’s sexual desire for her? Or was he testing her once again? She couldn’t figure him out.
“We received your call and have been waiting for you, sir.”

As soon as they arrived at a traditional Korean-style house, a woman in a hanbok came out and bowed in greeting. Only when they had gotten underneath the eaves did KyungHyun take his hand off her shoulder.
“Let’s go inside.”

The woman received the umbrella and quickly guided them to a room inside. As the door closed shut, EunHa heard traditional Korean music flow in from outside. She could only imagine the kind of customers that were inside the other rooms.
Even though they were in the middle of Seoul, it felt as if they were hidden in the mountains. This was a perfect place to have secret conversations.
“We need something to clean ourselves.”

As soon as KyungHyun spoke, the employee quickly brought in some towels. EunHa smelt an aromatic fragrance coming off of the towel as she carefully dried her damp hair and shoulders.
“You’re quite wet.”

“You’re right. I got wet even though I shared an umbrella with you, Director.”
“ time, you don’t have to be so awkward and stay so far away. Other people may think that I kidnapped you and was threatening you with gun.”



EunHa blankly gazed at him and laughed. KyungHyun stared at her and asked.
“Why are you laughing?”

“If I answer honestly, will you not fire me?”

“Go ahead. We’re officially done with work anyway.”

“I laughed because I felt that you’ve carried out plenty of kidnappings before, Director.”
“Are you talking about human trafficking?”

KyungHyun asked apathetically. EunHa shrugged her shoulders in response.
“Those Serim bastards are the only ones who make money by selling women.”
KyungHyun answered as he threw back a shot of liquor. EunHa couldn’t help but flinch when she heard the familiar name come out of his lips.
“And only poor, third-rate organizations make money off of things like organ trafficking.”
As KyungHyun continued speaking, EunHa tried her best to hide her surprise.
“I didn’t know there was a ranking system in this world.”

KyungHyun understood the meaning behind her words. She was saying that he was a pot calling the kettle black.
“It seems that Secretary Lee doesn’t have much loyalty to our company.”
“Since you told me it was okay to be honest, I’ll say this. I



don’t really have a sense of belonging wherever I go.”

“Then why did you come work for our company? Gangsters are people that value affiliations more than anyone.”
“Is that so?”

“Ah, and another group values it as well.” “Who?”
“Cops.”

“Haha.”

EunHa laughed when she heard his curt reply. KyungHyun chuckled as well.
“If I had to chose between the two, I’d choose the capable thugs over the incompetent police.”
“That’s pretty harsh.”

“Isn’t it pleasing to hear, though?” “Yeah, it’s not bad.”
KyungHyun emptied his second cup of liquor as he nodded. His complexion didn’t change at all, but he strangely felt comfortable today. Usually, he seemed like a man who wouldn’t bleed even if you pierced his skin.
“If you need anything else, please don’t hesitate to call.”

After placing all the dishes onto the table, the waitress closed the sliding door.
“Eat.”



EunHa picked up her chopsticks. She was suddenly thrust back into reality, and the room felt suffocating once again. This restaurant was basically buried at the foot of a mountain, and the rooms were so far apart that no one would know if someone was being killed inside one of them.
However, she also felt that it might be a bit easier to get closer to Shin KyungHyun here since there were no eyes watching them.
“… The reason why I came to KeumOh is because I wanted to take care of a personal matter.”
“You said that last time.”

Bracing herself for KyungHyun’s further questioning, EunHa had prepared a cliché and commonplace answer. However, he didn’t ask her for specifics and changed the subject instead.
“Whatever the reason is, it’s good to have a goal.”

His words sounded strangely pessimistic. EunHa stared at him before asking.
“Don’t you also have a goal, Director? Isn’t that why you work?”
Whether it was money or something else, there must be a reason why he was working at a company like YongSung. But for some reason, his expression seemed to say the opposite.
“No.”

KyungHyun stared at EunHa as she looked back at him with questioning eyes.
“I work because of my affiliation with the organization. The opposite of you.”



“Hmm, that sounds preposterous.”

EunHa murmured softly. She picked off a piece of the perfectly- cooked Korean pancake and put it in her mouth. Then she stretched out her hand towards the colorful and neatly prepared dishes. KyungHyun merely watched her eat and only drank the liquor. He was definitely a heavy drinker.
“This place is delicious.”

“I felt that it didn’t suit the tastes of the young people these days, so I was worried. I’m glad you like it.”
“Director, do you know that you sometimes speak like an old man?”
“I do?”

“Yes. Let me pour you a glass of liquor.”

KyungHyun had been drinking the liquor all by himself this whole time. She cautiously took the white gourd-shaped bottle and filled his cup.
“You speak completely different from the way you look.” KyungHyun downed the entire cup before chuckling at her words. “I’m nine years older than you. It wouldn’t be completely
wrong for you to call me an old man.”

“Wow. You were so proud of your older age not that long ago. I’m quite experienced for a twenty-six-year-old, you know.”
“Twenty-six, huh…”

He watched her eyes sparkle playfully before speaking again.



“I’ve killed someone at your age.”

EunHa had been busily moving her chopsticks when she heard those indifferent words. She froze momentarily.
“And not just a couple people.”

EunHa met his blank eyes. Her heart began to race.

“Sometimes I feel as if the people I’ve killed have come for my neck. If each person could pierce me one time, I’d definitely be a beehive by the end of it.”
KyungHyun laughed a little. EunHa replied softly.
“… Are you afraid of that? Being punished for all the bad things you’ve done?”
“If that were the case, then I wouldn’t have done all this up till now. I’m quite a shameless man. I’m good at finding an excuse for my behavior.”
“Then why did you say all that just now?” “I don’t know. Maybe I’m drunk.”
“To be honest, you don’t seem drunk at all.”

KyungHyun slightly frowned at EunHa’s observation.

He hadn’t gotten drunk for many years now. Even now, KyungHyun’s mind was on edge as it imagined a mob of men suddenly infiltrate the room with knives. He couldn’t help himself. It came naturally to him.
“Director.”

He focused his gaze on EunHa.



“Are you still thinking about firing me?”
“… Why are you asking? How could you ask that to someone who is buying you a meal?”
“It’s just… You look frustrated about something.” “How funny.”
KyungHyun held the liquor in his mouth as he stared at her. He couldn’t take his eyes off the woman who was sitting in front of him. Her posture was upright while her words were brazen. Maybe he was a bit drunk.
“You want to fire me, and you want to keep me by your side. Isn’t that how you feel right now?”
She might be right. KyungHyun was hoping that she would just give up on her mission and leave him right now. If she stayed by his side, she would inevitably run into some danger, so it was only right for her to avoid it while she still could. That was also a reason why he never got close to a woman.
While this was all true, for the past 2 weeks, he was hesitant to let her go. Why was that? Was it because he had saved her as a girl back then? Was there some kind of special meaning behind this feeling? KyungHyun was never this emotional, so he felt a bit strange.
“Why do I want to keep you by my side?”

EunHa’s lips stretched into a smile. Her smiling face didn’t have any wrinkles, as if she were still a young child. This was why he was so curious about how she had grown up.
“How would I know what’s in your heart?”

KyungHyun couldn’t take his eyes off her. She watched him and



crinkled her nose playfully.

“Well, I think I can take a guess.”

As EunHa raised her cup, KyungHyun quickly grabbed the liquor bottle and filled it. The liquor gave off a fragrant aroma.
“Alright. What do you think is the reason?”

The woman who had led a hard life answered back as if she had lived an easy life.
“Isn’t it because I’m a magical woman…?”

EunHa’s face contorted as she took a sip of liquor. The liquor burned her throat. She now realized that the liquor that KyungHyun had been drinking like water was an incredibly strong Chinese liquor.
“Cough!“

EunHa began to cough as the lethal sip of liquor went down her throat. She covered her mouth with a napkin and coughed a few more times. She couldn’t understand the sick, twisted people that actually enjoyed such strong liquor like this.
“Aaah… I almost died…”

EunHa took the napkin and wiped her eyes which had filled with tears. KyungHyun watched her, his elbow on the table and his head in his hand. He began to rub his face with his large hand. Even though his mouth was hidden, she could tell that he was laughing because his shoulders were shaking. EunHa fanned her flushed face, and his laughter became louder.
“Here. Drink some water, magical woman.” “It’s because it got caught in my throat.” “Did I say anything?”



KyungHyun’s expression returned to normal. He had planned on asking her in an indifferent voice, but he couldn’t keep the trace of humor from his voice. Seeing EunHa make a fool of herself while they were having such a serious conversation made him chuckle.
After that, KyungHyun kept his mouth shut, so EunHa could only focus on eating for the rest of the meal. EunHa sipped the Omija Tea that was brought in for dessert. She felt as if her stomach was full to the brim. She couldn’t eat anymore.
“Thank you for the meal.”

“General Manager Cha will be here soon with the car.” “Yes, sir.”
Thinking that it wasn’t as late as he thought, he nodded his head and hesitated before asking EunHa a question.
“If it’s alright with you, do you want to walk around a little while we wait?”
It was no longer raining. After walking out to the back of the parking lot, they saw a quiet path that was too narrow for cars to access. Streetlights stood along the path, so it was brightly lit. After looking around and deciding that it wouldn’t be too dangerous, EunHa nodded. This was a chance to ease the tension between them. She had no reason to turn down this opportunity.
“Sounds good. I ate too much, so it’s perfect timing.”

She slowly followed KyungHyun. They walked in silence for a while when KyungHyun suddenly spoke.
“How long have you lived in the United States?” “… Since 5th grade up until I graduated college.”



She answered him naturally, leaving out the unsavory details in between.
“Then you must feel more comfortable over there than Korea.”
“Not at all. I’ve always wanted to come back to Korea. I was only unable to return because of family issues.”
He didn’t ask any further. EunHa took advantage of the silence and asked her own question.
“Director, what did you… No, that’s not it. How did you first come to work at KeumOh?”
“Why, do I not fit in?”

“No, you look like you were made to enter KeumOh.”

EunHa looked up at him and grinned. Even though she had only been observing him for a short amount of time, compared to all the other people she’d seen, it wasn’t an exaggeration to say that KyungHyun was the person most suited for this kind of world.
He was different from SungHo, who seemed like he was born wicked and nasty. EunHa could never read KyungHyun’s mind.
That’s right. This was a world where two men could be brothers on one day and enemies the next. It was a world where people lived as they hid the darkest part of themselves from others.
“I was just curious about how you reached the position you’re at right now.”
“As I tried to live…”

EunHa slowly stopped walking. Small knats flew around the dim light of the streetlamps. Maybe because they were in the mountains,



EunHa also heard the faint cry of a bird. Thanks to the recent bout of rain, she could smell the damp dirt underneath her feet and the fresh scent of the trees.
“By the time I realized it, I was already here.”

KyungHyun came one step closer to her. Nobody was around. Even though they were still in the middle of the city, their surroundings were silent. Just as his large hand was about to touch her face, it suddenly whipped away. It was such a sudden movement that EunHa was unable to react. Her heart was racing furiously.
“… The mosquitos are out already.”

The faint, high-pitched buzzing noise next to her ear disappeared. KyungHyun brushed his hand, and a small, black bug fell out like dust. Possibly because of the way the light of the streetlamp was hitting his face, EunHa thought KyungHyun looked a bit different.
“Did I surprise you?”
“… Because one would normally think that something different would happen in this situation.”
EunHa’s trembling lips stretched into a smile. KyungHyun’s bent finger gently brushed against the spot on her face where the bug had touched. He came one step closer. They were so close that their chests were almost touching.
“What did you think would happen?”
“… I thought that you looked handsome.”

“From the look on your face, I don’t think that was it.”

“I’m serious. A man who can catch and kill a bug is just my type.”



KyungHyun’s face came closer to hers. He carefully rubbed her pink cheeks, almost as if he were touching a small animal. She could smell his cologne mixed with his natural body scent.
“Does Secretary Lee have a habit of saying whatever is on her mind when she’s nervous?”
“If I tell you what I really think, I’m afraid you’ll get mad, so I’m holding it back, Director.”
“I won’t get mad, so tell me.”

EunHa looked up at him and slightly opened her moist lips. With her finishing move, she gazed at him with bewitching eyes.
“…Really?” “Really.”
“I want to kiss you.”

EunHa whispered softly. He merely smiled dangerously and didn’t say a word, but EunHa didn’t miss the way his eyebrow twitched. After gazing at his face, she turned her face to the side. The finger that had been grazing her cheek now brushed up against her lips. As her breaths fell on his finger, she looked at him and whispered slowly.
“I was thinking that I wanted to kiss you.”

KyungHyun’s eyes darkened. His arm firmly wound around her hips. Suppressed desire burst out through the fingertip grazing against her cheek. His warm hand grabbed her face, his arousal dripped out of his every movement.
“Stop joking around.”

EunHa didn’t do much. KyungHyun had already been looking at her



with eyes that revealed his intense desire to embrace her. She merely fanned the flames.
“I’ll stop if you give me a kiss.” “I’m going to lose my mind.” “Because I’m so pretty?”
KyungHyun frowned and let out a laugh. Even though he looked angry, EunHa had a hunch that he was just incredibly aroused. EunHa’s long eyelashes lowered as she tilted her face up to him. Her eyes slowly closed. She knew that he would kiss her. His hand buried into her hair and firmly pulled her head towards his. Suddenly, they heard a loud noise and saw a bright light appear in front of their eyes. As the bright light pierced her eyes, EunHa reflexively turned her head.
Vrooom!

A motorcycle suddenly appeared out of nowhere, its engine letting out a loud groan. KyungHyun covered EunHa’s body with his as the motorcycle charged at her. He hugged her to his chest and threw both their bodies onto the ground.
“Agh!”

The motorcycle roughly turned around at the curb. EunHa suddenly got up, completely dazed. With her eyes wide open, she was just about to run away when KyungHyun pulled her back to his hard body and embraced her so that she couldn’t move.
Vrooooom!”

The motorcycle engine groaned again as it began to charge at them. The wheels roughly scraped the ground as it spun around. The wet mud splattered.



TN: Way to kill the mood, mystery motorcycle driver!!!






KyungHyun took out his gun from the back of his pants in an instant. EunHa remained still, petrified from shock. KyungHyun quickly wrapped his arm around her head and covered her ears as he pulled her to his chest. Then he took aim and pulled the trigger.
Pew!

Even though a silencer was attached to the gun, the sound of the bullet splitting through the air could be heard clearly. EunHa reflexively buried her body into the man’s embrace. Even in the foggy weather, the bullet accurately hit the front wheel of the motorcycle. Losing its balance, the motorcycle shook precariously. Shocked, the driver jumped off the motorcycle and flew through the air.
“Ugh!”

Rumble, rumble!

Before the driver fell to the ground, the motorcycle lost its balance and began to charge straight for KyungHyun and EunHa.
Shit!

EunHa’s eyes widened. They were going to get hit.

“Aaagh!”

Just as she was about to crawl away to avoid the crash, her body was roughly shoved to the side. KyungHyun took her in his arms and



rolled them onto the dirt path. The motorcycle charged into a tree a few meters away and crashed loudly.
“Ugh!”

Debris flew over KyungHyun’s head as he shielded EunHa with his body.
“Haa… Haa…”

Still inside his arms, EunHa looked up. She saw the driver toss his broken helmet to the ground and run away.
With a frightening expression on his face, KyungHyun aimed his gun at the driver. His eyes narrowed as he focused, and his thick arm tensed. When Eunha saw the half-shaven head of the frantically running man, her eyes widened.
Pew!

Having recognized YongJoon, EunHa grabbed onto KyungHyun’s arm right as he pulled the trigger. The bullet dangerously grazed YongJoon’s arm. He began to run even faster.
“Damn it.”

Cursing, KyungHyun got up to chase after YongJoon. EunHa could see General Manager Cha frantically run towards them from the direction of the restaurant.
“Are you alright?”

“I’ll leave Secretary Lee to you.” “No!”
EunHa tightly grabbed onto KyungHyun’s arm just as he was about to run after YongJoon. Frowning, he glanced down at her. EunHa let out a loud cry.



“I-I’m scared!”

She could find out why YongJoon did such a ridiculous thing later. She knew for a fact that if KyungHyun ran after him, armed with a gun, it would only be a matter of time before YongJoon’s corpse was discovered. If it was a bare-knuckled fight, YongJoon might stand a chance, but she could tell from just one look that KyungHyun was extremely skilled with the gun.
“What?”

She couldn’t tell what KyungHyun was thinking from his expression as he asked. EunHa looked up at KyungHyun, her eyes full of terror.
“I don’t want to be separated from you, Director. I’m scared.”
As she tightly gripped his arm, EunHa’s hands were damp with sweat. She wasn’t telling a complete lie. She did feel scared. When she saw the motorcycle charging at them, she really did think that it would crash into her, and that she’d finally see her parents in heaven.
She couldn’t calm her racing heart as her nerves buzzed. Her body was still in a state of shock. KyungHyun’s face hardened as he looked at her with a terrifying expression. He then let out a short sigh.
“… Director…?”

Suddenly, EunHa was being carried. After picking her up and bringing her to his chest, he began to walk. Confused, EunHa asked that he let her down, but it was no use.
“I can walk by myself.” “Stop joking around.”
In the end, KyungHyun carried her back up the mountain path.



General Manager Cha quickly opened the car door. KyungHyun placed her inside before getting in after her.
“I’ll take a look around.”

Click.

The door closed, and General Manager Cha disappeared. A heavy silence settled inside the car.
“If it wasn’t for you, that man would have died by my hand.”
His languid voice drawled. EunHa didn’t avoid his gaze as he stared at her. His piercing eyes seemed to be reading her thoughts.
“Why did you stop me?”

Did he realize that she stopped him on purpose? EunHa silently swallowed, her mouth dry. Then she parted her trembling lips.
“I wasn’t ready to see someone die in front of my eyes. I just did it instinctively.”
Her voice trembled at the thought of being caught as YongJoon’s accomplice. She comforted herself by telling herself that it only helped her sound more terrified.
“You’ve never seen a person die?”

KyungHyun asked in his low voice as he looked into her eyes. EunHa’s breath caught in her throat. She recalled her mother’s eyes as her bloody body was stretched out on the stairs. EunHa couldn’t help but close her eyes before opening them again.
“It’s not something a normal person sees very often.”

Because she always relived her parents’ deaths, she didn’t grow up as a normal person. As EunHa recalled that fact, she felt herself calm



down and her fears subside. It was more clear than ever why she was in a place like this. Why she risked danger and approached Shin KyungHyun.
“If it’s for the sake of my own life, I don’t hesitate to kill anyone.”
His voice was cold and cruel as he blurted these words out to her.
EunHa looked at him and whispered softly.
“…I’m glad.” “About what?”
“…As long as you’re next to me, I feel that I won’t die.”

KyungHyun stared at her before biting his lower lip. EunHa thought she saw the end of his lips go up for a second.
“Then next time, don’t waste your energy trying to run away and stick right next to me.”
He was talking about the moment when EunHa was struggling to escape as the motorcycle was charging at them. When EunHa nodded in agreement, KyungHyun’s narrow eyes softened a little.
“Are you hurt anywhere?”

His indifferent voice returned to normal.
“No, I’m fine…”

As EunHa nodded, a large hand grabbed her leg. Her skin twitched as his hot hand touched her. When he had carried her earlier, she was too out of it to notice his body temperature. But now she still clearly remembered his fierce strength as he crushed her to him.
“Director, I’m really fine.”



“I’ll be the judge of that. You fell hard on this side back there.”
KyungHyun grabbed her angle as he murmured.

“Why is your ankle so thin?” “It’s normally that thin for me.”
“It looks like it can break so easily.”

EunHa was about to ask him if this was the first time he held a woman’s ankle, but she quickly suppressed that urge. This was because his frowning face didn’t look pleased at all. He was bigger than an average man. Even though their bodies were bound to be different, it looked like he couldn’t understand that fact.
KyungHyun silently massaged her ankle, checking for any broken bones. Only when he saw that she was perfectly fine did he let her go. EunHa thought it was finally over, but KyungHyun suddenly brushed his thumb over her cheek. A strange tension filled the air.
What was this? Even though this didn’t seem like the appropriate time to kiss, nothing was impossible. EunHa slowly closed her eyes.
“……”

She heard a small noise. Instead of lips, something else touched her face. She opened her eyes to see what it was. KyungHyun was holding a handkerchief. He had wet the handkerchief with some water from the water bottle in the car and was using it to clean off the dirt on her face. EunHa blinked, completely stunned.
“Your expression looks frozen.”

KyungHyun rubbed her browline as he looked at her.
“…I was just a bit surprised. That’s all.”



“About what?”

“I didn’t think you’d carry something like that around.” “…A gun?”
“A handkerchief. It’s quite gentlemanly.”

“Stop saying ridiculous things and keep your mouth shut.”

He folded the handkerchief. He continued to wipe her face, but he was gentler when he was at her nose and lips. EunHa began to blush.
“Close your eyes.”

His careful hand began to wipe around her eyes. He slowly moved over her closed eyelids. She could feel his finger through the thin fabric. For some reason, EunHa felt these simple movements were more sexually provocative than anything she’d experienced before.
After he finished cleaning her face, KyungHyun folded the dirt- stained handkerchief and simply put it back into his suit pocket. As she saw his suit jacket ride up, she saw the gun hanging on his hip.
EunHa felt that the black pistol and the checkered handkerchief smelling of his musk suited him very well. For some reason, she felt herself blush. It had been feeling hot inside the car for a while now.
“I’ll open the window for a bit.”

The cool night breeze brushed against her face. She heard a car door open and close as she leaned her head back. It seemed her body was still high on dopamine from when the speeding motorcycle almost hit them. She could hear her heart beating rapidly in her ears.
“Go inside.”

After dismissing the driver, KyungHyun drove EunHa to her apartment himself. He ignored her protests and her claims of being



perfectly fine and walked her up to her apartment door.

“Thank you for bringing me home.” “Get some rest.”
His soft, low voice echoed in the empty hallway. EunHa gave him a slight nod.
“Drive back safely.”

EunHa carefully opened her front door and went inside before closing it. The motion detector lights in the entryway turned on. After checking that nobody was inside, she finally relaxed and let out a sigh. She was worried YongJoon or another henchman sent by SungHo would be here. She thought her head was going to explode with dread as they walked across the parking lot and went up on the elevator.
Ding dong.

She heard the faint sound of the elevator’s arrival outside her door. Still leaning her back on the door, EunHa didn’t move. Then she finally began to head for the bathroom. She turned on the hot water and washed her hands. She took off her dirt-stained blouse and skirt. She looked into the mirror and saw that all her makeup had been wiped off her face. It seemed that it had been wiped off with the dirt when KyungHyun had been rubbing her face with his handkerchief.
After tossing her dirty clothes into the hamper, she walked across the living room only in her underwear. She took out a bottle of water from the refrigerator and began to drink it down. She must have been thirstier than she thought. She finished the whole bottle in one go.
Her temple pulsed due to the quick intake of cold water, but she felt her mind become clearer. She threw the empty plastic bottle into the trash bin and bit her lip hard.



‘Just what was that idiot YongPal thinking?’

After finally being able to relax by herself, EunHa was filled with rage as she recalled YongJoon’s actions. The unexpected dinner with KyungHyun was nothing compared to the shock she received after the meal. No matter how much she thought about it, EunHa couldn’t figure out why YongJoon suddenly attacked KyungHyun like that.
She felt that she needed to tell SungHo about what happened immediately. Even though she knew that SungHo would be absolutely furious when he found out, she believed that YongJoon had to stop his impulsive acts for his own good. If she was one moment too late, that motorcycle would have hit her for sure. She ground her teeth just thinking about it again.
EunHa walked over to the mattress and began to search underneath it for the hidden cellphone when she suddenly froze. Due to her dangerous lifestyle, she had developed an unexplainable intuition. It wouldn’t be a bad idea to make sure her surroundings were secure before calling SungHo. No, it was probably the right thing to do.
“……”

She silently walked over to the front door. Blink.
She carefully brought her eye to the peephole located on the center of the door. She looked out, but nothing was there. For a moment, she had wondered if KyungHyun was standing there with his ear to the door. But that was just an unfounded worry. EunHa let out a long breath.
Ding.

She saw the elevator door open through the small peephole.



When she saw KyungHyun appear through the doors, she didn’t even have time to be surprised. His face came closer to the peephole in a quick second when she heard him enter the passcode.
Shocked, her eyes narrowed when the door suddenly burst open. Her hand had been on the doorknob, so when the door suddenly open, she was pulled outside and into KyungHyun’s firm chest.
“Haa…!”

She barely managed to get herself together and stepped back. His frowning eyes were filled with desire as he saw her clad only in her underwear. He impatiently brushed back the hair that had fallen over his furrowed forehead with his hand. EunHa tried to hide her confusion and opened her mouth.
“Director, why are you still… Hmm…!”

The feel of his hand on the nape of her neck felt familiar. EunHa’s eyes widened. KyungHyun didn’t even give her the chance to close her eyes.
His hand felt hot as it traveled from her nape to her cheek. Her skin tingled. He bit her lips. EunHa hesitated before walking backwards. KyungHyun didn’t break away from the kiss and stepped forward, following her inside. He wedged his thick tongue between her lips and entered her mouth in an instant.
“Haa…mmm!”

He continued to suck her mouth, completely absorbed in the kiss. He entangled her tongue as if it belonged to him. One of his warm hands was on her cheek. The other firmly gripped her bottom, which was only covered by her thin panties. EunHa was helpless as he pushed her inside her apartment.
Bang.



The door closed shut behind KyungHyun. Beep, beep, beep. EunHa flinched when she heard the door automatically lock.
KyungHyun pulled her body up against his. EunHa could feel the hard ridge of his cock push up against her panty-covered mound. As the stiff rod poked her in a sensitive spot, a moan left her lips. His grip on her began to gradually tighten.
“Haagh…!”

KyungHyun roughly licked around the inside of her mouth, poking the back of her tongue. As he sucked on her sweet tongue, she could feel his breaths brush over her face.
EunHa’s mind went blank as she felt him greedily cover mouth with his. She felt that she could finally see what was hidden behind Shin KyungHyun’s cold mask through their kiss. Like a savage beast that snapped the windpipe of its prey, there was no hesitation in his movements.
“D-Director…Hnng!” “Stay still.”
He spoke, his lips still touching hers. His voice sounded rough like sandpaper. The clear, distinct bulge of his penis through his suit pants began to rub up against her hidden clitoris.
Something deep within her twitched, and a zing of pleasure traveled up her spine. Soon, something hot dripped out of EunHa and wet her panties. KyungHyun’s middle finger traveled from her bottom up to the wet spot on her panties. Then his finger began to rub her above the fabric.
“Hmm…!”

EunHa’s body trembled at the stimulation and began to react. She tried to press her thighs together to stop his hand, but it was no use.



KyungHyun easily pulled them apart. Then he began to rub her again. In the end, her juices drenched her underwear and made his finger slippery.
“Hnnng…!”

KyungHyun finally pulled away from her lips, and a soft moan slipped out. KyungHyun’s eyes darkened as he looked down at her expression.
“Director, can I ask what you’re doing right now?” “Is this your first time kissing?”
His hot breaths brushed over EunHa’s wet, swollen lips.

“Of course not. What I’m saying is, why are you suddenly doing this to me?”
“This is your punishment for daring to tell me you wanted to kiss me.”
His sudden actions made her heart thump heavily inside her chest. His grasp on her bottom was so tight that she felt that she’d burst. Her body was tense. EunHa let out a huff and grasped his shirt.
“Haa… for a punishment, isn’t this too nice?”

KyungHyun frowned at her provocation. His Adam’s apple moved as a rough groan escaped his lips.
“…You like it?”

KyungHyun put his forearms underneath her bottom and lifted her up. EunHa wound her arms around her neck for balance.
“Aaah!”

Her surroundings spun. Her back flopped onto the mattress. EunHa



was glad she had asked SungHo to order a premium mattress.

“How did you know my passcode?” “I had a hunch.”
“Are you investigating me?”

“Did you really not expect that to happen when you applied to a mob organization?”
She wanted to protest, but she knew that her words wouldn’t get through to him. KyungHyun took off his suit jacket and tossed it to the ground. He placed the gun secured to his hips onto the table with a thud. EunHa hid her confused expression and swallowed.
“Isn’t this all happening too fast?”

“It may seem like that to you, but not to me.” “What do you mean?”
“I’ve been in this state since you started working half a month ago.”
KyungHyun placed his hand on top of the bulge in his pants and lightly grasped it. At his gesture, EunHa’s face reddened.
“You have quite a lot of patience, Director.”

“My bedside manners aren’t very good, I’m afraid.” He slowly walked over EunHa, who was laid out on the bed. “What’s wrong with your bedside manners?” “You’re about to find out.”
His black gaze fixed onto her as he slowly loosened his necktie.



KyungHyun swept back the few locks of his hair that had fallen over his forehead. Even though they hadn’t touched, EunHa felt as if she could feel the heat radiating off of him.
EunHa finally realized why she tensed up whenever his gaze was on her. She knew for sure after having shared a kiss with him. His eyes were very similar to his kiss. They both had the ability to make a person drown in them.
“… Are you going to kill me?”

“I don’t know. What do you think?”

Tap, tap.

The buttons on his white shirt fell away all at once. He tore open his shirt and took off his top all at once. His rugged muscles were revealed.
EunHa reflexively drew her breath. How much did a man have to exert himself to obtain such a perfectly muscular body? She saw a tattoo stretch across his left chest back around his shoulder. However, she didn’t have a chance to see where the tattoo ended. KyungHyun approached the bed and gripped her hips. Suddenly, her black, silk panties were lowered to her knees.
“Ah, ah!”

She didn’t have a chance to hide herself. She had planned to give him a striptease to make him lose his mind with lust, but those plans flew out the window.
KyungHyun watched as EunHa squirmed in shock before wrapping his sturdy arms around her thighs and fixing her so that she couldn’t move. Then he crashed his mouth to the area between her thighs. As she felt something hot and wet brush against her sensitive spot, a moan automatically burst out of her lips.



“Aaah…!”
EunHa lifted her hips, bringing it closer to his lips. He didn’t caress her clitoris gently with the tip of his tongue. Instead, his thick tongue licked across her entrance and her clitoris in long strokes like a beast.
He found the spot that gave her the best pleasure and furiously sucked. Once her slick juices trickled out, he plunged his tongue into her entrance.
“Ah, aagh. Direc…tor… Aaaah…!”

She couldn’t stop the wave of pleasure. EunHa sat up and tried to push him away, but her weak protests only provoked him even more.
“Ugh!”

Both of her legs were suddenly lifted up so that they were now right in front of her face. She had basically been folded in half. In this positilon, her entrance was brought out in clear view. She didn’t have time to feel embarrassed. KyungHyun pressed down on her thighs and didn’t take his face away from her entrance. His tongue continued to plunge into her.
His wet, hot tongue lapped at her before it eventually traveled down and brushed past her anus. A sharp cry burst out of EunHa’s lips.
“No… Hnng!”

Slick with her juices, his lips went back up to her clitoris and began to suck. He simultaneously rubbed her entrance, and soon the room was filled with embarrassing wet sounds. EunHa’s face turned bright red.
There was no hesitation in the man’s movements. EunHa couldn’t show her bewilderment at his smooth actions. He had always treated



her like a child, and EunHa didn’t want to be treated like one in bed as well. EunHa grit her teeth and let out a groan.
KyungHyun’s love play was as persistent as his personality. As the blood continued to pulse through her core, her wet entrance twitched and began to contract. EunHa’s toned thighs began to tremble. She reached her peak without any warning.
“Aaah, aagh!”

EunHa twisted her head into the pillow as she cried out. Her sensitive sex trembled as a transparent fluid flowed out, dripping onto the cotton sheets on the mattress. Her swollen breasts were still in her half-cup bra and moved up and down with her panting breaths.
KyungHyun slid his hand behind her back and took her bra off. EunHa was now completely naked. KyungHyun looked down on her nude body with appreciation in his eyes before he wiped his wet lips and with his hand and licked it.
“You’re pretty tasty.”

EunHa’s delicate body was pressed down by the man’s warm, hard body. KyungHyun’s low voice spoke up as he lay over her. She could feel the sticky sweat where their bare skins touched. She could feel the rapid heartbeats vibrate through their skin. She didn’t know which heartbeats were hers and which were his.
TN: □ Ermahgerd…This is a lot more graphic than I expected.







“I’d love to suck you some more, but I’ve reached my limit.”
KyungHyun raised his hand and rubbed the tears away from her eyes. Drunk on pleasure, EunHa only then realized that her eyes had filled with tears.
“Ha…Haha…”

EunHa wasn’t sure if she was crying or laughing. KyungHyun’s large hand squeezed her voluptuous breast. Even though he was squeezing it so hard that it felt like it’d burst, the pleasure overrode the pain.
“You look like you regret seducing me.” “No, you’ve misunderstood.”
“Then what are you thinking?”

“I was thinking that it’s the first time I’ve been aroused to tears.”
EunHa’s whispering voice sounded sensuous. Her clear face was without makeup. A deep blush had risen on her cheeks. Watching her laugh with tears in her eyes, KyungHyun was incredibly turned on.
“Director, your body feels very hot… It feels nice.”

EunHa’s slender fingers grazed his spine.



“I hate being cold.”

At her light touch, KyungHyun’s remaining patience flew out the window.
“Ah, aaagh!”

He squeezed her breast and nibbled and sucked on its peak. EunHa’s breath caught in her throat. The sound of KyungHyun’s mouth on her breast rang throughout the room. KyungHyun unbuckled his belt, took his pants off, and threw them onto the floor. His boxer briefs were taught as his cock stood up. It looked angry, as if it was impatient to enter the soft body underneath him.
“Please… Let me suck you too, Director… Aagh!”

EunHa reached down and hooked her fingers under the bands of his underwear to lower them. However, she wasn’t able to do it. KyungHyun had squeezed her breast in his large hand and began to massage it as he bit down on her perky nipple.
“Don’t get cheeky, kid.”

Actually, he just couldn’t take it any longer. The veins on his cock were pulsing, and the tip was already wet with cum.
Before his dinner with EunHa, when they were walking to the restaurant underneath the umbrella, he was already heavily aroused. If it wasn’t for the unexpected entrance of the unwanted guest after the meal, he would have kissed her. There was a chance that he wouldn’t have been able to control himself, and he might have ripped her clothes off outside and taken her then and there.
The fantasies of having sex with her played on repeat inside his head. The settings would change from the squash courts, his office, and inside the car. He recalled all the places where he had his way with her in his fantasies.



“Relax and open your legs as wide as you can.”

KyungHyun’s hot voice whispered into her ear as he parted her legs with his knees and settled himself between her thighs.
“Do you really think I’m a kid?” “What do you mean?”
“This isn’t my first time, haa, so you don’t have to be so careful with me.”
At EunHa’s murmur, a sexy smile stretched across KyungHyun’s sweaty face.
“…Alright, then.”

After the abrupt kiss, EunHa was dazed from all of KyungHyun’s caresses, so she hadn’t had a chance to see his package. The swollen head of KyungHyun’s penis entered her wet entrance. As she felt him begin to slide in, her red lips parted in surprise as her pretty eyes narrowed.
“Haaaa…!”

EunHa’s body trembled. It wasn’t that she was in pain. It was just that his thick rod was filling her so completely that she felt as if she couldn’t breathe. Her whole body was silently screaming as he continued to enter her. Stretched to the limit, her walls tightly gripped his cock. KyungHyun licked the tender skin under her ear and murmured in a husky voice.
“Are you always this tight? I can barely get in.” “No, it’s not me, it’s… Aaagh!”
“See? You’re gripping me so tight and won’t let me go.”

It wasn’t like she could control it. EunHa gasped as she struggled



to accommodate him. KyungHyun suddenly frowned as he quickly thrust his hips. His thick penis was now completely inside her.
“Haagh!”

“I’m about to come. You need to relax.” “Then just get it over with.”
EunHa was being honest. She was drowning in the most intense pleasure she had ever experienced. It made her feel a sense of dread. KyungHyun caressed her cheek with his hand.
“I can’t do that. We just started.”

His cock was completely wrapped up inside her, and it was rubbing up against her sweet spot. Even though he hadn’t started moving, just his penetration made EunHa feel as if she was about to tip over the edge. She wrapped her arms around him and pulled him to her.
“Haaagh… Haaa…”

KyungHyun brought his face up to hers. Her face was flushed as she gasped for breath. His hard body was pressing down on her.
“It will be best if you don’t drive me crazy. You won’t be able to handle me.”
If she were with any other man, she would have tempted him with her usual bewitching words. But for the first time, she was at a loss for words. At the rate this was going, she felt that she really wasn’t going to be able to handle this. Her instincts were on edge as if she were in danger. This… wasn’t a joke.
Slap! Slide. Slap!

His hips pulled out before slamming back in. It was so fierce that it gave off a sound. As his hips began to pump, EunHa could feel him



pierce through her walls. His thrusts were so powerful that every time he entered her, he would crash into her clitoris, making a surge of pleasure run up her spine. She felt as if the temperature inside the room had gone up. Her whole body felt as if it were burning.
She couldn’t control herself as she felt the pleasure pile up. Every time his cock rubbed inside her, she was in ecstasy. Every time he thrust into her, he would hit her sweet spot as well as her clitoris, making her body scream silently.
“Aaah! Haa, nnng!”

EunHa cried out as the pleasure gradually built up.

“Don’t close your eyes. I want to see you feel it.”

Every time her eyes were about to close, he would bite her lips and kiss her. And so her eyes stayed open. KyungHyun was pumping into her from above. His large hand was holding her face. His face looked terribly powerful, and it only served to excite her even more.
“I like your expression the best when you’re feeling it.”

KyungHyun spoke as if he were talking to himself. He crouched down and raised her hips, trying to get even deeper inside her. His began to pump furiously inside her as his pace sped up. The sound of their bodies slapping gradually got louder. EunHa’s moans became more choppy and rough. KyungHyun’s penis glistened as it continued to pump into her. Suddenly, a creamy substance began to burst out of her entrance.
“Aaagh! Aaaaaagh!”

EunHa buried her nails into KyungHyun’s back as she cried out. He plunged into her completely before moving more slowly. As another powerful wave of pleasure went over her, EunHa shook her head and moaned. As her orgasm spread through her, KyungHyun captured her lips and began to suck.



“Hmm…!”
Her breaths puffed through her nose. When their lips parted, EunHa tried her best to think clearly through the haze of her climax. This man was dangerous. This was the first time she couldn’t think straight while having sex with someone. If she didn’t get the upper hand in this relationship soon, she was going to completely collapse.
“Director.” “What is it?”
He began to squeeze her breast, causing EunHa to gasp.
“I want to, hnnng, be on top now…!”

As soon as she finished her sentence, KyungHyun flipped them over with his cock still inside her. He sounded like he was completely drunk with lust as he whispered.
“…Ah, you like it this way?”

She didn’t have a chance to sit up and ride him because KyungHyun tightly held her to his chest. Once he steadied his feet on the mattress, he began to violently pump his hips up as he thrust into her.
“As you wish.”

Her entrance was still twitching from her climax, but KyungHyun’s cock began to hammer into it once again. As he had warned her earlier, KyungHyun didn’t go easy on her. As the wet sounds fill the room, EunHa’s bottom reddened as it continuously slapped against KyungHyun’s hips. The throbbing pleasure rolled through EunHa’s body once again, and her muscles began to stiffen. Her heart raced so fast that it felt like it would burst.
“Aaaagh! Aaahng!”



KyungHyun searched for EunHa’s breast. When he found it, he covered it with his mouth. He grabbed it with his hand and sucked on the peak. Her climax hit her body and spread. Even though EunHa was the one who was riding KyungHyun, KyungHyun was the one who was invading her.
Her whole body was trembling as her arousal boiled over. The pleasure spread from her fingertips to the tips of her toes. In the midst of all this, her mouth had gone dry. She felt as if fireworks were going off in her head. Thanks to their position, she could feel KyungHyun’s cock go deeper inside her.
This didn’t make sense. This really didn’t make any sense.

“Hnng, hnnnng!”

EunHa began to move her hips up and down in order to facilitate KyungHyun’s climax. Slap, slap, the sounds of their bodies smacking together began to get louder as it rang in the room. A groan slipped through his clenched teeth as he looked up at her.
“I told you not to drive me crazy.” “Aaah!”
His large hand smacked her bottom. At the tingling shock, her body began to tremble. He didn’t hit her that hard, but having her bottom slapped as she were being punished made her feel humiliated. Her face began to turn red. However, she also felt something else stir inside her.
KyungHyun clenched her bottom with both his hands so that she wouldn’t be able to run away. Then he violently began to pump into her from below. He was moving too fast. Every time he plunged into her so deeply, more fluids leaked out of EunHa’s entrance. The fluids dripped down and drenched his pubic hair.
“Nng! Hnng! Aaagh! Aaah!”



“Open your eyes. Don’t close them and look at me.” “Can’t, aaah, hnnng!”
KyungHyun crashed his lips onto hers once again, and EunHa couldn’t help but open her eyes. He was truly a man with a terrible personality. His black eyes pierced through her as she was being shaken up and down with the force of his thrusts. The moment their eyes met, all thoughts flew out of her head. She only wanted to fly over the edge of the approaching hellish climax.
Eventually, EunHa began to suck on his tongue as she cried out.
Her slender body trembled as a fierce orgasm rushed through her.
“Haa… Haa…”

EunHa felt as if her body had become boneless. KyungHyun embraced her and began to rub his chin on the top of her head. Having experienced multiple orgasms in a row, EunHa’s entrance continued to contract and relax as it milked KyungHyun’s cock.
“I’m not finished yet.”

EunHa’s hot breaths brushed against his wide chest as she tried to return to her senses. When she heard KyungHyun’s words, she looked up. Possibly thinking that she was going to try to escape his embrace, KyungHyun slid inside again with a strong thrust.
“You’re really… amazing.”

EunHa swallowed, her mouth dry. Even though her words were said in true admiration without any sarcasm, KyungHyun didn’t seem to take it that way.
“It doesn’t seem to be a compliment.”

“Are you usually slow to climax? Or is it that I’m just not to your taste?”



“Of course not. I’m delaying it on purpose.”

KyungHyun carefully brushed EunHa’s wet hair from her forehead as he whispered. Even though he was still slowly rocking into her, each thrust was fierce as he bit and sucked on her breast like an animal. EunHa felt her head become muddled.
“Do you want me to finish quickly?”

“It’s nice if we both feel good. What’s good is good.”

She didn’t know what she was saying right now. KyungHyun wrapped her legs around his hips and turned them to their sides.
EunHa didn’t like doing it on her side because it felt a bit ticklish to her, but at this point, she wanted KyungHyun to quickly finish and leave her alone. After multiple orgasms, she had cried out so much that her throat hurt.
Chu, chu.

KyungHyun pressed his lips to hers a few times before moving to the side. His hot breaths blew over the tender spot below her ear. EunHa reflexively shrank back. KyungHyun’s mouth moved and sank his teeth into the nape of her neck. EunHa’s body tensed up once again.
“I believe I already told you at the squash courts about how I have a lot piled up.”
“But this is a bit much.”

“Just what are you standards, then?”

Even if he had a lot piled up, the sex was just too long and persistent. KyungHyun pressed a kiss to her soft cheek and murmured.



“Don’t compare me to the other rookies you’ve been with.” “That’s not… hnng… what I…!”
“Then quit saying things like that and just feel this. I’ll get you to the peak again.”
EunHa shook her head as she felt this horrible man’s cock slide in and out of her.
“No more, that’s enough…Hnnng!”

His fingers began to flick her swollen nipples. Her breasts already felt sore from being treated so harshly by his mouth. She bit her lips as she tried to hold back her moans. As he watched her, his eyes were still full of unsatisfied desire.
“If you say you like it, then take me until the end.” “It’s good. It’s good, but I’m so tired…!”
“Can’t you tell that I’m going easy on you for your sake?” “Go easy my ass…!”
EunHa furtively glared at him with red eyes. She tried to settle him a bit with her sharp eyes, but KyungHyun became even more riled up instead. Every time KyungHyun’s hips pulled back, the muscles above his firm bottom twitched.
“Haa, hnnng! Not so deep… Aaagh!”

EunHa’s moans began to get louder again. Once again, her body began to betray her reason. Her slick entrance welcomed KyungHyun’s intrusion and began to suck him in.
“So you like it hard. You’re giving me a stronger response now than when I was going easy on you.”



KyungHyun stretched out his hand and began to rub her clitoris.
“It’s very wet…”

Every time KyungHyun’s cock drilled in, she got wetter and wetter. Because of their position, she could only look straight at his face. KyungHyun opened is eyes sensuously and gave her a faint smile.
“Listen to the sounds it’s making.”

EunHa’s breath caught in her throat as she felt the blood rush to her face.
“Pervert.” “Correct.”
KyungHyun agreed with her and lowered his head for a kiss. His tall nose bumped against hers, and their tongues tangled. She couldn’t think straight again. As his cock plunged deep inside her, she felt as if her walls had all become sensitive. Their bodies were sticky with their sweat, their fluids, and their saliva.
She had never had such intense, sensual sex before. EunHa acknowledged that KyungHyun wasn’t bluffing when he warned her before. Having sex with KyungHyun was enough to knock her out.
“Aaagh, enough. Don’t suck there, aaah, anymore, aaaah!”

KyungHyun put more strength into his thrusts. He brought EunHa to the cliff once again and mercilessly threw her off. The pleasure built up like a snowball rolling downhill before ultimately exploding inside her.
“Aagh…!”

KyungHyun watched her squirm in pleasure and finally reached his limit. He flipped EunHa over. Like a dog, EunHa was now gripping the



mattress as KyungHyun pounded into her from behind.

“Nnng!”

His hot hands wrapped around her hips as he began to piston into her. EunHa’s mind went blank. She could barely breath as she felt his penis reach deep inside her with every thrust.
“Ah, aaah!”

Her arms gave out. She couldn’t hold it any longer. EunHa buried her face into the fluffy pillow as she sobbed. Instead of slowing his pace, KyungHyun began to increase the power behind his thrusts.
“Hold on a bit longer.”

Sweat dripped from KyungHyun onto EunHa’s pale bottom. KyungHyun’s eyes traveled to his glistening rod that was currently thrusting in between her bottom cheeks.
“…Looks good. Very good.”

Even if KyungHyun hadn’t mumbled those words, EunHa knew just what her body looked like at this moment. The point of their connection was already a mess as it was covered in a creamy fluid from all the friction. The swollen walls of her entrance continued to squeeze him as it followed him in and out.
She felt the familiar ecstasy begin to rise from her lower abdomen. Her body twitched as if an electric current was running up her spine.
“Please… Please, Director… Haagh… Please…!”

Her body was shaking from her climax as her begging became louder.
“Please what? What do you want me to do?”

KyungHyun’s breaths were choppy as he bit out his reply through



clenched teeth. At this rate, EunHa felt that they would have sex throughout the night. Her shrill voice split through the hazy room that smelt like sex.
“Come for me. Right now…!” “Haa, what?”
KyungHyun’s voice sounded hoarse. KyungHyun turned his face to her. His frown was scary to see, but he couldn’t hide the intense arousal in his terrifying expression. He was incredibly turned on by her words. EunHa narrowed her eyes and licked her lips.
“Director… I want you… to come… in me… inside me.
Please… Hnnng!”

Silent fireworks burst within KyungHyun’s eyes as he buried himself inside her. His heavy body pressed down onto her. He grasped both of her hands in his. Her walls were milking him so fiercely that it felt like he was being completely sucked in.
“Ah! Aaah! Aaagh!”

After opening her taut thighs with his knees, KyungHyun inserted his slick cock between them and began to rub furiously. Feeling as if her whole body was an instrument for his pleasure, EunHa cried out and began to tremble. He raised her face from her pillow and caught her lips with his own. With eyes wide open, EunHa watched his face as his climax ripped through him.
“Ugh…!”

A sticky, warm fluid spurted between EunHa’s thighs and bottom. The insides of her thighs were trembling from the friction. They were covered in semen and her own fluids. The small tremors traveled up her body until they reached the top of her head.
There was no sense of relief now that it was finally over. Her mind



had gone completely blank, and no thought entered her head. She felt as if her body wasn’t her own. The aftershocks of her multiple orgasms were still buzzing through her body.
“Come here.”

After thrusting between her thighs a few more times, KyungHyun finished spending himself. He gathered her boneless body to him. Boom, boom, EunHa could feel his racing heart against her cheek.
He pulled the crumpled sheet up over her body and began to rub her arm with his large hand. EunHa’s panting breaths gradually calmed.
“…Have you settled down a bit?”

EunHa’s lips let out a weak sigh.

“Now you ask? After everything you did to me?”

She could feel his puff of laughter against her skin. EunHa drowsily turned her head to look at him.
“I’m serious. Aren’t you embarrassed to ask me a question like that?”
“That’s why I gave you plenty of chances to run away from me. You shouldn’t have hung around me like a mischievous kitten in the first place.”
“I didn’t know I’d be completely outmatched in your bed, Director.”
“It’s fine. Now you know.”

KyungHyun’s lips stretched into a smile as he met her eyes. His expression still looked cold, but he looked a bit more relaxed than usual. EunHa thought it might have be due to the disheveled locks of



hair that fell onto his forehead.

Having sex with Shin KyungHyun was definitely a part of her plan. Normally, at this point, she’d feel that she had successfully infiltrated the man’s defenses and fall into a relaxed sleep.
“What are you thinking about?” “…Guess.”
“Do you regret sleeping with me?”

“If that was the case, I would have pushed you away.”

So many thoughts were flying through her head. The images of what they had just done continued to invade her thoughts. KyungHyun’s hand slowly rubbed her body as he murmured.
“Then why does your face look like that?” “What’s wrong with my face?”
“You look frustrated.”

KyungHyun was lying on his side as he he watched her drowsily. He lightly tapped her forehead with his finger. EunHa’s face unconsciously stiffened as he treated her like a child.
“When you’re in bed with me, don’t think of anything else other than sex.”
“…I’m human, so how can I do that?”

“Should I make it so that you can’t think of anything else?”

At his loaded question, EunHa quickly shook her head.

“No, I’ll have to refuse for now. I’m seriously about to lose my mind. I never thought that I needed to work out more, but



I feel that way now. I think I need to try harder. I need to register at a gym and get my stamina back up…”
“Are you nervous right now?”

KyungHyun pressed her head against his chest and slowly whispered. EunHa swallowed.
“No, why?”

“Whenever you’re nervous or confused, you talk a lot. Like a loud baby chick.”
“…Have you ever seen such a large baby chick? Maybe a hen is more apt.”
KyungHyun’s shoulders shook lightly. Strangely, EunHa didn’t feel like leaving his embrace. She felt as if a heavy, warm blanket was covering her.
“Alright, so don’t think of anything else and go to sleep.”

Would she be able to fall sleep next to this man? She had seduced this cold-blooded man and finally had sex with him. He wasn’t going to make it easy for her to leave him. Even though things were going according to her plan, EunHa couldn’t shake off this sense of foreboding. Her whole body was sending her alarms of impending danger, and Shin KyungHyun had noticed. She knew well enough that this man wasn’t going to be easy to handle.
As her eyes traveled to the gun on the table, EunHa reminded herself that she mustn’t show him any crack in her armor ever again.
“I can hear the gears in your head turning.”

EunHa flinched at KyungHyun’s voice before tightly shutting her eyes. She could hear his steady breaths behind her back. As she waited for his breaths to relax, EunHa ended up falling asleep.



TN: Phew! That was intense…□ Crazy first smut scene of the novel!







Not a lot of people frequented the connecting powder room of the women’s bathroom on the top floor of the department store. A young woman wearing all brand-name clothing was fixing her makeup before she exited the bathroom. Nobody was left inside the room, and only the soft piano music could be heard. EunHa quickly took out a cellphone from her purse and quickly pressed the speed-dial button. The phone rang ten times before someone answered.
⦁	Hello?
“Are you crazy?”

She could hear the loud sound of a television in the background when YongJoon answered the call. He answered her as he dragged out his voice.
⦁	Is that how you start a phone call? What kind of bullshit is this? EunHa bit her lips and lowered her voice to a whisper.
“Why did you appear all of a sudden two nights ago? I told you not to appear in front of me as much as possible, didn’t I? Were you really trying to run me over?”
Two days had already passed since the night YongJoon had charged at EunHa and KyungHyun with his motorcycle.
⦁	You and Shin KyungHyun looked so awkward, so I just added fuel to the fire. Thanks to me, you and that bastard fucked like rabbits, so what are you bitching at me for? You’re pissing me off.


“I can do everything fine on my own. Why did you go and do something you weren’t even ordered to do? Does Ahjussi know you’re going around acting like a complete idiot?”
As EunHa spoke sharply in utter disbelief, YongJoon began to raise his own voice.
⦁	If Boss didn’t order me to do that, why would I have done it?
Don’t you know that the son of a bitch almost killed me?
⦁	Hey, let’s keep it down. We’re all watching TV here, jeez.
⦁	Fuck. Hey, you old geezer, shut your trap! Or else you’re dead meat!
YongJoon shouted threateningly. EunHa frowned as she stood completely still.
“What did you just say?”
⦁	I almost went to see my maker, didn’t you see?!
“I saw it very clearly. I also saw you running away with your tail between your legs. But are you serious? Did Ahjussi really order you to do that?”
One week ago, she contacted SungHo to give him her report, and he hadn’t said anything in particular. He only ordered her to thoroughly investigate the people that Shin KyungHyun had met with. As always, the pervert asked if she had slept with KyungHyun yet. EunHa merely told him that she was going to take her time capturing him. He didn’t say anything else about it.
So why?

Whenever they were carrying out a plan, it was an unspoken rule that every participant had to inform each other of what was going on. If there was even one little hiccup in the plan, it could cost someone



their life, so it was very important. EunHa’s brows furrowed.
⦁	Yeah, fuck. Thanks to you, I even got shot. I didn’t want it a big fuss from the cops, so I couldn’t even go to a hospital to get it checked out. I’ve been feeling like shit because of that. How was I to know that the crazy bastard was going to shoot at me in the middle of Seoul?
EunHa swallowed when she heard that he had been shot. She clearly recalled the way he had looked as he pulled the trigger. If she hadn’t grabbed his arm, would YongJoon have made it out alive?
“Are you badly hurt?”

At EunHa’s question, YongJoon dragged out his answer.
⦁	It just grazed my arm.
Figures. If it was serious, he wouldn’t have answered the phone like this. EunHa felt relieved. But that didn’t change the fact that SungHo had acted independently without telling her. Something felt off, and EunHa was feeling frustrated.
“If something like that happens again, give me warning beforehand.”
⦁	I wasn’t planning on attacking you. Boss just told me to scare him and provoke a reaction out of him. But that bastard went ahead and started shooting at me, so…
YongJoon’s breaths became choppy as he remembered the events of that night. EunHa spoke to him in a calm voice to soothe him.
“There’s such a thing as being team player. If you warned me beforehand, you might not have gotten hurt, and I wouldn’t have been so surprised.”
⦁	…Were you very surprised?


YongJoon’s voice sounded faint as he asked awkwardly. EunHa shook her head.
“It’s fine, so just shut up and get treated. And don’t go scaring people around you either.”
⦁	Alright. I’ll let you know next time so stop your nagging.
“Noona will be grateful if you do.”

YongJoon suddenly yelled out as if he remembered something.
⦁	‘Noona’ my ass. Ah, now that I think about it, you’re the one who told me not to appear in front of you or contact you! Ah, go easy on it, lady! You’re not just disinfecting it, you’re making the cut even worse, fuck!
EunHa could hear the surprised nurse drop something, causing a metallic clang to ring through the receiver. Suddenly, she heard the murmurs of a woman and child come in from outside the bathroom.
It was time for her to leave. EunHa swallowed and lowered her voice as she quickly whispered into the phone.
“I’m scheduled to attend the KeumOh founding party today with Shin KyungHyun.”
Actually, this was the main reason she called YongJoon. Having received this unexpected information, YongJoon’s voice also lowered a bit.
⦁	Founding party? Where?
“I don’t know. I only heard about it today.”
⦁	Are you okay going alone? Have you reported this to the boss?
“No, tell him for me. Because of his efforts, I fucked my brains out with Shin KyungHyun. Thanks to Ahjussi, I think



it’ll be easier for me to get some information out of him.”

EunHa ignored YongJoon’s reply and ended the call. After taking out the SIM card, she threw the phone into the garbage bin. At the same time, a mother entered the bathroom with a stroller. EunHa quickly exited the bathroom. General Manager Cha was looking at his watch to check the time. When he caught sight of EunHa, he looked exasperated.
“The Director is here. Hurry up.” “Yes, sir.”
EunHa followed him into the elevator. Ding, the elevator stopped and the doors opened. As she exited the elevator, EunHa let go of the SIM card. The card slipped through the cracks of the elevator doors.
All of the people near KyungHyun were issued company cellphones, and as a member of the secretarial department, EunHa wasn’t an exception. Even though she was throwing away the only cellphone given to her by SungHo, it would be too dangerous if Shin KyungHyun caught her with two cellphones.
KyungHyun was more of a thorough perfectionist than she thought. She had expected him to relax a bit in bed, but she had been mistaken.
Two days ago, EunHa had unknowingly fallen asleep after having had sex with KyungHyun. She woke up in the middle of the night. Making sure she didn’t disturb KyungHyun, EunHa began to carefully get up. Suddenly, she heard a voice from her side call out, ‘Where are you going?’ She answered back that she was going to the bathroom. As she walked over the the bathroom, he followed her inside.
“… I want to close the door.” “I don’t want that.”

In the end, she used the toilet in front of Shin KyungHyun. She



didn’t think anything would come out, but she tensed her stomach for a bit and managed to get a trickle. Once she could get a trickle, the rest followed easily. She finished cleaning up and flushed the toilet. KyungHyun leaned on the doorpost and calmly gazed at her.
“You have strange tastes.”

She suppressed the embarrassment and awkwardness deep inside and looked up at him in disbelief. KyungHyun suddenly picked her up.
“This is what happens when you have people around you that you can’t trust.”
EunHa fell asleep in his arms for a few more hours before waking up again. Making sure that he had truly fallen asleep now, she snuck out of the bed. She kept her eye on him in the dark, but KyungHyun remained still.
She saw his cellphone next to the gun on the table. Believing this was the time to find some information, she began to head for the bathroom. She was planning on taking Shin KyungHyun’s cellphone later.
Just as she was about to open the toilet tank lid to grab the equipment hidden there, she had a strange feeling that she was being watched. She quickly turned around. She almost let out a shriek. Shin KyungHyun was leaning his head on the doorframe and watching her with his signature blank expression. She had been listening for any noise outside, and she hadn’t heard any sound of his movements at all. She could only imagine what would have happened if she laid a finger on his cellphone.
“Do you use the bathroom this often?” “I… wanted to take a shower.” “It’s 3 in the morning right now.” “Because of someone, my body is a mess and feels sticky. I can’t fall asleep.”



KyungHyun’s expression slightly relaxed. Before EunHa could feel relieved, KyungHyun entered the bathroom and grabbed her hand.
Whoosh.

He turned the shower valve and hot water poured out of the shower head. EunHa felt the water spray down on her. Before she knew it, KyungHyun had grabbed her bath sponge and pumped body wash onto it.
“There’s no need to put that much…” “It’s for two people.”

KyungHyun chuckled as he rubbed the foaming bath sponge over her body. Even though the water was still pouring over her body, the soapy foam didn’t wash off very easily due the vast amount of body wash KyungHyun had poured onto the sponge.
“Turn around.”

KyungHyun began to rub her back. The bath sponge had already been tossed onto the floor. His warm hand rubbed the rose-scented soap onto her back. His other hand traveled to the front of her body and began to slowly rub her breasts.
“Hnng…!”

EunHa took a step forward to avoid his wandering hand. The water fell right onto her face, so it made it hard for her to breathe. The moment she turned her head to the side, his lips covered hers. She pretended to deepen the kiss before sharply biting KyungHyun’s lower lip. KyungHyun softly laughed into her lips.
He grabbed her lower stomach and pulled her to his body. She could feel his body temperature against her back. His penis was fiercely poking against her bottom. In an instant, KyungHyun’s cock slipped between her thighs and easily entered inside her. EunHa regretted leaving the bed. She had basically taken one step forward and two steps back.



“Haaa, nng!”

Thanks to their slippery bodies, KyungHyun easily moved in and out. He grabbed her breast with one hand and teased her clitoris with the other. He pumped his hips behind her, and the sound of slapping wet skin began to grow louder. The bathroom was now full of steam. EunHa’s cries became more frequent. Eventually, KyungHyun turned her into his embrace and pinned her to the wall.
She wrapped her arms around his neck and wound her legs around his hips. Her body frantically shook as she met his thrusts in midair. Only after reaching her pitch-black climax did she finally leave his embrace.
“Do you think you’ll be able to fall asleep now?”

His languid voice sounded so annoying to her at this moment. She couldn’t hold it back anymore and replied.
“I think you’re also having a hard time falling asleep, Director.”
EunHa stood in the bathroom with trembling legs. She wrapped her hand around his still-erect penis. KyungHyun didn’t reject her advances. Instead, he lowered his head and buried his face into her chest. He took turns sucking on her neck, her chest, and her nipples. Thanks to his ministrations, EunHa’s was unable to keep her mind on his cock in her hand.
She felt a shiver of fear run down her spine. If she nodded off for a moment, she was afraid she would be eaten alive by this man. Suddenly, a dizzying climax rolled over her. She felt as if she was riding a never-ending rollercoaster ride. As the ride became more thrilling, the climaxes became greater and greater. KyungHyun began to pump his cock into her hand as if he were having sex. After leaving numerous red marks on her pale body, KyungHyun finally exploded.



The soap had long been washed away from their bodies. KyungHyun grabbed a large towel and wrapped it around her. Like last time, he lifted her into his arms and walked her to the bed.
The next day, when EunHa woke up, she felt as if her body had been beaten to pulp. She barely managed to open her eyes. KyungHyun was immaculately dressed as he sat at the table and drank his coffee from a to-go cup.
“When did you bring your clothes?” “Last night, I asked General Manager Cha to leave a bag of my clothes hanging outside your door.” “I never heard you call him.”
EunHa spoke with an awkward smile.

“I sent him a text. I was thinking about calling him, but since you seem to be such a light sleeper, Lee HaEun-ssi, I decided not to.”
He wasn’t wrong. EunHa was a very light sleeper. Especially when she was sharing a bed with somebody else. She was never able to completely relax, and she considered this to be something that just came with the job. If it were with any other man, she would have noticed when he left the bed, but she hadn’t been able to feel KyungHyun moving at all throughout the night.
‘It’s probably because I was so tired.’

She told herself that it was an incredibly persistent and fierce bout of sex. After consoling herself, she got into his car and they both went in to the office together. Thanks to a few cups of coffee, she managed to finish up her work. EunHa was worried that he would take her up to her door again for repeat of last night. As if he read her mind, he drove her to her apartment and drove off with a refreshed expression on his face.
Feeling a deep sense of relief, EunHa returned to her apartment



alone. However, for some reason, she still couldn’t shake off the feeling that something was off. So that night, EunHa stayed up searching around her apartment.
She thought that there was a huge chance Shin KyungHyun had installed a surveillance camera or a listening device while she was asleep. She checked the bathroom mirror, the air conditioner, even the fire alarm on the ceiling. But she wasn’t able to find anything. The cellphone taped under the mattress was still there, and the equipment wrapped in plastic inside the toilet tank hadn’t been touched.
Still, something felt strange. So she threw away the cellphone given to her by SungHo. She thought things would get easier once she finally managed to sleep with Shin KyungHyun. She was wrong.
Now she knew. He was a crazy man in bed, and instead of loosening his suspicions on the woman he slept with, he raised his defenses instead.
I can’t show any weakness in front of him.

If he caught her trying to copy data off his cellphone, the gun that had aimed for YongJoon’s heart would have instead been aimed at her head.
“Director, when did you arrive?” “Just now.”
EunHa, who had been lost in thought, looked over at General Manager Cha as he bowed to KyungHyun. The man who had been in thoughts all this time was finally here.
Instead of the usual elegant black suit that he wore, he wore a more formal navy suit with a gray handkerchief peeking out of his left chest pocket. He was dressed for the founding party scheduled for today.



Even though he looked like a skilled, level-headed businessman, inside his outer shell, he was still a thug who committed violent crimes. EunHa preferred that side of him. It wasn’t a crime to do bad things to a bad man.
“What would you like me to do here?” “Go shopping.”
“What are you looking to buy?”

“I want to buy some clothes for the party today.”
“Um… I think the clothes you’re wearing right now look amazing enough, Director.”
EunHa wasn’t lying. He looked like he had just gotten out of a magazine pictorial. KyungHyun shook his head.
“Not for me. For you.”

EunHa now realized why KyungHyun had called her here to the department store. The clothes she was wearing right now wasn’t quite appropriate for a party.
“How fun.”

“Do you like shopping?” “Spending money is the best.” “Alright. Pick whatever you want.”
“Wow. It’s been so long since I bought something without looking at the price. My heart is racing. It’s even better because I’m not even spending my own money.”
KyungHyun chuckled. If this is how he wanted to show off in front of her, she’d take it anytime. On top of that, today was KeumOh’s



founding party. All the executives and associates at KeumOh would be there. Today, she had been sent out on an assignment in the morning, so she wasn’t told where this party would be held yet.
She had a strong feeling that she would be able to see YongSung’s boss, Noh HyungChul, at this party. She would possibly be making her first impression on him, so it was very important that she did her very best to catch his eye. As long as she caught his eye, everything else would naturally go her way.
She aggressively began to shop. She picked two racks worth of dresses. KyungHyun ordered her to quickly change into one now since they didn’t have enough time. EunHa followed his command and went inside a changing room to change.
“That looks nice.”

EunHa had changed into a fluttering, elegant, cream-colored dress. KyungHyun nodded in approval. However, EunHa changed her mind and changed into a black dress instead. Seeing her exit the changing room in a dress with a plunging neckline, KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed. He slightly bit his lips and didn’t say anything.
“I’ll go and buy the shoes now.”

She went inside a brand-name shoe store and found a pair of heels embedded with crystals. She put the sparkling shoes on. She even bought a thong so that the panty line wouldn’t show through the thin material of the dress. Behind her, General Manager Cha handed the store employee a credit card on behalf of KyungHyun.
“There isn’t much time, so wouldn’t it be better for you to change your panties here as well?”
Following the pervert’s orders, EunHa changed her underwear. Then KyungHyun ordered her to buy a matching purse. EunHa picked a small, bright clutch that was on display at the store.



“Put your things inside the purse. I’ll send someone to take the rest of your things and send it to the office.”
EunHa felt relieved when she heard KyungHyun’s words. She thanked the heavens that she had disposed of SungHo’s cellphone earlier. She opened her purse. She reached her hand inside the bag to grab her wallet and pouch, but her hand touched something heavy instead. EunHa brought her hand out of her purse and saw that a bright, diamond pendant was dangling in her hand.
When did she put this in here?

The perfectly-cut gems were sparkling as it refracted the lighting in the room.
“I chose the jewelry according to my tastes.”

The price of this necklace would definitely overshadow the price of the dress, shoes, and purse combined. The necklace was extravagant but elegant. It looked dreamy. If he truly did pick this according to his tastes, then he was into high-end products. EunHa quickly blinked her eyes, feeling a different type of giddiness than when she stole something.
“Come here.”

When EunHa didn’t move, KyungHyun took the necklace into his hands and went behind her. He lowered his head. A pleasant weight pressed down onto her chest. Then she heard a small metallic click. His breaths on the back of her neck felt hot. Recalling how hot this man’s body was despite his cold facial expressions, EunHa’s heart began to beat faster.
“It suits you.”

KyungHyun went back around and took a good look at her. His eyes lingered on her in appreciation.



“Are you really giving this to me?”

EunHa looked up at him as she asked, one perfect eyebrow raised up.
“Why? You don’t like it?”

“What woman would reject a gift like this?”

“Good. I spent a long time deciding on this necklace. I was going to get annoyed if the recipient didn’t like it.”
“Is this compensation for sex?”

EunHa looked at him and asked defiantly as she laughed. Because General Manager Cha was standing a few paces away as he kept a lookout, she wasn’t afraid to ask KyungHyun now. KyungHyun gazed at her and answered her question in his usual languid voice.
“I’m not so needy that I need to give a woman money for sex.”
“It might mean that sex with me was just that good.”

KyungHyun slightly swept his tongue inside his mouth. His black eyes darkened. As EunHa watched his reaction, she whispered softly.
“It wasn’t that great for me, though.”

He frowned at EunHa’s words. He looked down at her and then began laughing in disbelief. A breathy groan escaped his wide lips. Feeling that she finally landed a small but direct blow on him, EunHa shrugged her shoulders.
TN: Uh oh… EH, you’re playing a dangerous game here…






“Then shall we go? General Manager Cha has been looking at his watch for a while now.”
“Alright.”

KyungHyun lightly placed his hand on her hips. Even though he was only placing his hand there to escort her out, EunHa felt as if her skin was burning as she felt his heat through the thin fabric of the dress. EunHa quickly followed his steady strides to the parking garage.
“We’ll be departing now.”

The car wasn’t the usual sedan that KyungHyun usually rode. This time, they were getting into a black van. The driver was already waiting inside.
“Is General Manager Cha going to follow us in a different car?”
At KyungHyun’s affirmative reply, EunHa asked another question.

“Why?”

“There’s a lot of people that follow my car around. If they catch on to me, I’ll have to take a detour.”
Their conversation was short, and the car door closed shut. A silence settled inside the car. Eunha glanced at him a few times before looking at the seat next to her. She finally spoke up.



“If I knew I was going to be attending today, I would have paid more attention to my makeup.”
“You don’t have to pay attention. You look fine as it is.”

KyungHyun was looking at his tablet as he replied. Were those empty words a compliment? She couldn’t tell because he was continuing to browse through the tablet with a serious expression. EunHa changed the subject and asked an earnest question.
“Where is the founding party going to take place?” “Bucheon.”
EunHa tilted her head. The company didn’t have anything to do with that town.
“We’re going all the way to Bucheon?”

“It’s best that we go to a place where we won’t be seen by a lot of people.”
KyungHyun murmured in reply.

“If a bunch of gangsters in suits are gathered together, it will catch a lot of eyes.”
This meant that they were being very careful with security for this event. It was understandable. The executives of KeumOh were meeting with the gangsters of YongSung in one place. Nothing good would come out of having this location leaked. EunHa disguised her voice to sound nonchalant as she asked another question. Her eyes were full of curiosity.
“Does that mean we’ll be seeing the president as well?”

KyungHyun took his eyes of the tablet screen and looked at her. EunHa didn’t look away from his sharp eyes and laughed innocently.



“He’s an incredible person. They say he doesn’t make a lot of public appearances, so I just wanted to know what kind of person he was.”
“Today will be the same.”

EunHa swallowed back the disappointment that rolled over her. Even though it wasn’t a part of SungHo’s mission, it was a part of hers. She wanted to meet Noh HyungChul as soon as possible.
After being attacked by a gangster a few years ago, Noh HyungChul now only met with a few select people that he trusted. And one of the few people that he met with was sitting right next to her. Shin KyungHyun.
She thought that if she got closer to KyungHyun, she would be able to find a chance to approach the president. However, it looked like that was going to take more time. If she was going to have some pillow talk with KyungHyun, she needed to make him completely fall for her… But as she recalled their sexual intercourse from a few days ago, EunHa let out a heavy sigh. Would she even be able to get KyungHyun to completely lose his mind?
‘What should I do?’

“What are you thinking about?”

EunHa, who had been completely lost in thought, flinched when she heard his voice. She turned her head. She could see that KyungHyun’s eyes were glued on her. The tablet in his hands had disappeared at some point. With his elbow on the headrest, KyungHyun was rubbing his lips as their eyes met. Reflexively, EunHa turned her head back forward.
“Why are you avoiding my eyes?”

EunHa became flabbergasted at his words. It was because his sharp gaze looked as if it was reading her thoughts.



“Do you have something to say to me, sir?”

She turned her eyes back to his and replied to him with an indifferent and polite tone. KyungHyun’s eyes slowly lowered and stopped at her chest. They gazed at the sparkling diamond necklace hanging from her neck. EunHa couldn’t tell if he was looking at the necklace or at her chest, but she didn’t feel embarrassed at his direct gaze.
“Not really.”

“Then why are you looking at me like that?”

His deep, dark eyes met her eyes once again. Usually, they never listened to anything in the car when they were going somewhere. However, today, the dreamy voice of a jazz singer flowed out of the impressive speaker system.
Maybe it was because they were dressed differently than usual, or maybe it was because of the slow music floating around her ears, but EunHa felt as if she and KyungHyun were currently sitting at a high- end bar. KyungHyun stared at her as he murmured in a low voice.
“I’m looking because I like what I see.”

“Of course you do. You chose it yourself. I like the necklace as well.”
“Not the necklace. You. The more I see you, the more you’re my type.”
EunHa silently blinked. KyungHyun was still calm and composed. His long fingers stopped rubbing his lips and moved to his temple. His eyes were still on her. EunHa watched him and spoke in a low voice.
“On my first day, you warned me not to tempt you. If you come on to me like this, I can’t help but feel that it’s



cheating.”

From her experience, the more she pushed a man away, the more he would be drawn to her. This man in front of her should be no different.
“Are you saying that I’m tempting you right now?”

He was testing her again. EunHa carefully smiled back at him.

“People usually don’t gift something like this to a mere friend.”
As EunHa looked down at the diamond necklace on her chest, KyungHyun’s lips slightly went up.
“You might be misunderstanding it.” “Or I might not.”
“What do you think?”

“If I’m being honest, it’s a bit intimidating.”
“At the squash courts, you’re the one who hit on me first.” “That’s because I didn’t know what kind of position you
held and what your personality was like.” “Really? What do you think about me now?”
“You told me that your woman will be confined for 24 hours and won’t be able to go outside. I’m an incredibly free spirit, so that sounds scary to me. I hate it.”
“Then you shouldn’t have thrust yourself at a man on a rainy day and asked him to kiss you.”
EunHa shrugged.



“Maybe the liquor was too strong that night.”

“I don’t fuck women who are black-out drunk. It’s too boring.”
As KyungHyun said this indifferently, EunHa’s cat-like eyes widened. Even though music was playing inside the car, it wasn’t loud enough to drown out their conversation. They weren’t the only ones inside the car. The driver was still here. Seeing that KyungHyun wasn’t paying any attention to him, EunHa realized a gangster would always be a gangster.
“There’s no way a youngster like you forgot about how we had sex all night a few days ago.”
“Director, isn’t it a bit misleading to say that what happened a few days ago was of my own will?”
“So did you hate it?”

KyungHyun’s languid voice asked her. If he wasn’t so skilled in bed, she might have laughed at him. Disappointed that she couldn’t do this, EunHa answered in a quiet but clear voice.
“Well, it was okay.”

KyungHyun blankly stared at EunHa before sweeping his face with his hand. EunHa could see him smile behind his fingers as he rubbed his lips. He flashed his teeth and lightly bit his bottom lip. Just as she was wondering what was so funny, he suddenly stretched out his hand, wrapped his arm around her hips, and pulled her to him.
The familiar scent of his body that she had come to know so well lingered at the tip of her nose. She could even smell the scent of his sweat on his warm body. EunHa’s mouth went dry. She swallowed and barely managed to open her lips.
“…What are you doing?”



“I know I’m not the type to be considerate of others.
However, your lukewarm reaction isn’t pleasing to hear.”

“You know your enemies very well. If you knew me that well, you’d be completely invincible. It’s okay. Just try a bit harder next time.”
“You had better stop chirping or I’ll kiss you.”

“I’ve already done so much more with you, Director. Why would I be scared of…”
Before EunHa could finish, KyungHyun placed his hands on her cheeks. The back of her head was pushed back to the headrest. KyungHyun’s lips suddenly crashed into hers.
As if punishing her, he tangled her tongue with his and sucked. As he sucked her lower lip, the memories of that night filled her head. Remembering the intense pleasure, EunHa’s body automatically began to react. A shiver ran down her spine and her lower stomach twinged.
“Haaa…”

When their lips parted, EunHa gasped for breath. Even with lipstick smeared on his lips, KyungHyun looked incredibly sexy. Is this why famous makeup brands used men for their advertisements? As ridiculous thoughts filled her mind, EunHa tried to get a grip. KyungHyun watched her struggle to come to her senses and gave her an order in a low voice.
“Spread your legs.” “What?”
“I need to check something. Raise the hem of your dress and spread your legs.”



“I… I don’t think that would be proper to do that in a place like this.”
“Is there a reason why I have to act proper in here?”

Even though it was true that he was the highest ranking person in here, it still wouldn’t be right. Just as she was about to reply, KyungHyun’s hand pushed between her thighs and spread her legs. As he looked into her eyes, a long finger brushed against her black thong.
“You’re already wet.”

She tried to close her legs and move his hand away, but she failed.

“Are you always this wet for someone you think is just ‘okay’?”
As he threw her lie back in her face, KyungHyun began to grope her sex without any hesitation. His long middle finger rubbed her clitoris before lowering to her entrance. As he repeated this motion, a hot fluid began to flow out of her opening.
“This is the softest and the most honest part of your body.”
KyungHyun wrapped his arm around her shoulders and softly whispered. He spread her juices around her clitoris like a lubricant and rubbed it fiercely.
“As much as I like it when you’re dripping wet, it’ll be troublesome if you ruin your dress.”
“Then you… hnng, shouldn’t put me in such a troublesome state, Director. Don’t you think?”
Trying to hold back her moans, EunHa blurted out her response through her teeth. However, KyungHyun’s hand didn’t stop.



“I don’t think so.” “Why not?”
“Because I kind of don’t want to.”

His long middle finger slipped inside her drenched entrance. EunHa bit her lips and held back her moan.
“Your personality… haa… is absolutely terrible.”

“I’m making you feel good right now, so how can you say that?”
The wet noises began to grow louder. As he softly rubbed inside, her climax rolled over her in an instant. KyungHyun’s hot, dry lips brushed against her ear as he asked.
“You know your body is making some good sounds. Can’t you hear it? Just be thankful I didn’t lay you down as soon as we got inside the car.”
Even if the car was large and there was more distance than usual between them and the driver, there was no way the driver didn’t notice the heated exchange coming from the back of the car. Even though it was impossible for them to have car sex in a situation like this, EunHa had a feeling that she wouldn’t be able to avoid sex when it came to KyungHyun.
If the end result was going to be the same, then she needed to capture him perfectly now. EunHa frowned at KyungHyun and whispered softly.
“Do you like it when other people watch?” “Does it bother you?”
KyungHyun followed her gaze and glanced at the driver as he



asked.

“It’s not my style to be watched. It’s a different story if we’re all doing it together, though.”
“Stop joking around.”

Even though he knew she was only saying it to provoke him, KyungHyun sharply glared at her. Even though he knew who she really was, he couldn’t help but be fiercely drawn to her. His body reacted whenever he saw her. It was too intense to blame it on their past history.
KyungHyun had guessed that there was only one way to solve this problem. As long as he had sex with the object of his desire, his heart would settle and his sexual appetite would be satisfied. That was why he continued to embrace this young girl in her twenties. Their first time was done on purpose, but in the middle, he lost all reason and the flames continued to blaze.
“Are you not interested in having a threesome?”

And it was all because of this woman in front of his eyes who asked such a fearless question. KyungHyun let out a sigh. He took out his wet finger from inside her and swept back his hair.
“Park the car.” “Yes, sir.”
The driver answered immediately and suddenly stopped the car on the shoulder of the road. If they continued on like this, it was obvious to KyungHyun that he was only going to be thinking about this for the entire duration of the party. He knew he wasn’t acting like himself, but his patience had already hit rock bottom.
Concerned that she might be hiding a weapon underneath her clothes, he had ordered her to completely take everything off and



change into new clothes. However, at a certain point, he had completely forgotten the purpose of this and began to enjoy it himself. When he saw her captivating appearance, all the blood rushed to his lower half. He barely managed to calm down, but as she continued to act like a mischievous puppy in front of him, he couldn’t stop the urge to pull her into his embrace and tease her.
“Aren’t we in a hurry?”

EunHa corrected her rumpled clothes and took out a compact mirror from her purse. He probably instinctively knew that things would turn out like this. When he met her again after 10 years, he hesitated having sex with her and even tried to scare her away.
In everything he did, he needed to always expect the unexpected and assume the worst. All these thoughts began to get tangled up in his head. After having spent so many years in this organization, he had adapted his mannerisms to their ways. So when Lee EunHa suddenly appeared before him, he didn’t realize that he was beginning to act unreasonable.
Having lived up till now with his walls up against women, he had gone completely crazy for Lee EunHa’s body. It didn’t matter, though. What he knew for certain was that he only had an intense desire to completely dominate this woman in front of his eyes.
Living a life of order and routine, KyungHyun just wanted to survive. Because of this way of life, he had never desired anything so desperately before. However, now that the target of his desire was this woman, he was incredibly aroused.
“Get out of the car and wait outside.”

EunHa watched in disbelief as the driver silently left the car without a word, leaving the engine on. Without a chance to ask what was happening, EunHa was suddenly pulled towards him. At the same time, KyungHyun pushed his face between her legs like a dog.



He grabbed a hold of the band of her thong and pulled it up to her bellybutton. It pushed against her hidden clitoris and caused it to throb. Suddenly, a hot tongue pressed against it.
“Haaa…!”

The thick piece of flesh wiggled around as it dug into her. KyungHyun began to suck. EunHa wanted to at least take off her underwear, but KyungHyun didn’t allow it.
“My underwear… is getting wet!”

“It doesn’t matter whether you wear something this or not.”
This pervert, who wouldn’t know anything about the purpose of a woman’s underwear, began to push and pull on her panties, mimicking the motions of sex. He continued to stimulate her clitoris as he plunged his tongue inside.
Chuu, chu, the embarrassing sounds rang inside the car. All she could see was his wide back as he sucked the fluids that were flowing out of her.
EunHa’s thighs began to tremble. KyungHyun’s finger moved her irrelevant panties to the side. His lips and tongue surrounded her soft entrance. Like iron powder gathering around a magnet, EunHa felt a tickling sensation overwhelm her body.
“Aaagh!”

As KyungHyun continued to suck her as if he was trying to absorb her, EunHa couldn’t stop a groan from escaping. She pushed against his shoulder with her bare foot. KyungHyun lifted his head.
“Why are you pushing me?”

His perfect face was covered in her juices, and it looked dirty and



erotic.
“The stimulation was too…strong.” “So you came?”
EunHa gasped for breath. She felt an electric current run down her lower half. Her entrance throbbed painfully. After being stimulated by his thick tongue, her sex seemed to be crying out for more.
“I’m completely turned on right now. Because you were so tasty.”
He began to tease her sensitive spot with his finger again. As if taunting her, he whispered dirty words into her hear.
“Did you know that your whole body is just like you? Your pussy. Your nipples. They all look sexy. Just like your lips.”
“What… do you mean when you say they look sexy? What does that mean?”
EunHa babbled her question in confusion as she gasped for breath.
He lightly bit her earlobe and whispered in a hoarse voice. “It means that I want to put my lips on it.” “Haa…”
“I means that I want to bite, lick, and suck it.”

EunHa flushed when she heard his languid voice. She fumbled around in search of his cock. As expected, it was straining underneath his pants, pushing up against the fabric. Hmmm, the man’s husky moan rang in her ear.
“I want to do it.” “Do what?”



He calmly asked back. While his voice was calm, his erection underneath her hand was as hard as a rod. It made her desire to win grow stronger.
She had the urge to see him lose all his composure as he took her like a beast again. Even though this feeling probably only arose due to her own arousal, she didn’t care. Her throbbing entrance wanted a deeper stimulation.
“I also…”

EunHa began to grope his cock with her slender hand as she licked her red lips.
“I also want to eat you, Director. Put your thing inside me.” “Are you running your mouth again?”
“I’m serious. I want to do it. Right now.”

“It’s not good to be so honest. You shouldn’t overdo it.”

He stroked her plump lower lip and murmured. His breaths were more strained as he tried to suppress his own desire.
TN: Here we go again… □







“That’s unfortunate. Then I have no choice but to ask the driver outside to help me…!”
Suddenly, two of KyungHyun’s fingers entered her mouth. His forefinger and his middle finger began to rub against her tongue.
“You’re doing that on purpose, aren’t you?”

Unable to speak, EunHa groaned. Her saliva welled up at the back of her throat. She could smell the slight smell of cigarettes mixed in with his body musk on his hand.
“Huu…”

“If you’re trying to make me jealous, you have succeeded.”

KyungHyun spoke languidly. Desire dripped out of his eyes as they narrowed. His fingers were drenched with her saliva. Suddenly, EunHa heard the unbuckling of a belt and the sound of a zipper. KyungHyun wrapped his wet fingers around his erection and pumped up and down a couple of times.
“Haaa…”

EunHa gasped for air once his fingers left her mouth. KyungHyun took the remaining high heel off her foot and tossed it onto the floor of the car. EunHa’s knees touched the floor next to the seat. When KyungHyun pressed down onto her back, EunHa raised her head. KyungHyun was also on his knees, and his cock was now right in front of her face.



“Hmmph…!”
Unlike his fingers, his cock was much bigger as it entered her mouth. She wasn’t even able to brush her tongue across his tip to taste the precum. Like the rest of his body, KyungHyun’s penis was big and stiff as the veins throbbed.
“I’ll make it so that you can’t think about anyone else’s dick but mine.”
“Hmm…!”

KyungHyun’s hands that had been softly stroking her head now moved down to cover her cheeks. It was already difficult to fit him inside her mouth, but now KyungHyun began to move in and out. EunHa frowned and did her best to suck on his cock. She felt his hand tense up on her cheeks.
“Hmmph!”

As he reached the back of her throat, more of her saliva leaked out and dripped down his penis.
“If you keep doing that, it’ll only get more difficult for you.”
EunHa ignored him and brushed her tongue over the base of his penis and began to fiercely suck. Watching her suck his cock with reddened eyes, KyungHyun couldn’t stop the surge of desire from welling up in his. Having lost all restraint, KyungHyun pushed deeper into her mouth. It felt as if he were being sucked into her body.
“Hmmph! Hmph!”

Drip, drip. As KyungHyun thrust his hips, tears began to flow out of EunHa’s eyes. KyungHyun quickly grabbed his penis and pulled out. EunHa gasped and whispered in a hoarse voice.



“It was just getting good, so why did you stop?” “I thought I was going to come in your mouth.”
She gave him a strained smile. KyungHyun laid her out on the seat.
Then he covered her body and whispered into her ear.

“It felt too good.”

He placed a kiss next to her eye and opened her legs with his knees. The inside of her thighs were drenched as her fluids dripped down. KyungHyun mercilessly widened her legs and easily entered her.
“You feel very hot inside. Did you get aroused just by sucking my dick?”
“Haahng! Nnng!”

Instead of answering him, EunHa let out a moan. Just as he said, her whole body was incredibly flushed. As her walls made a way for his penis to enter, they automatically began to milk him as they throbbed and tightened around him.
“Wasn’t it hard?” “I-It was hard…!”
“Do you like doing things the hard way?”

His stiff rod rubbed up against her walls as it began to pull out. EunHa’s mouth went dry at the incredible pleasure the motion created.
“I just like… strong men. Hnng, that’s all.”

KyungHyun licked his lips and laughed softly.

“I like strong women too.”



As KyungHyun covered her body and thrust into her, EunHa wrapped her legs around his sturdy hips. When she lifted her hips to get closer to him, KyungHyun brought his hands to her bottom and lifted her off the seat before ramming into her. Their gasps and moans rang within the tinted windows of the car.
“Haaagh!”

He was so deep inside her. Every time he thrust inside, EunHa felt as if she was so full that she couldn’t breathe. She almost couldn’t believe how good this felt. She felt as if the car was shaking with every thrust he made.
“You’re eating me just like you wanted. How does it feel?” “Nnng! Haaahng!”
“Is it so good that you can’t even speak?”

He wasn’t wrong. Due to the intense build-up of pleasure, she couldn’t answer him properly through her panting breaths. She wanted to grab onto his shirt, but she was afraid it would wrinkle, so she wrapped her arms around his neck instead.
KyungHyun almost pulled out entirely before plunging back inside to the hilt. He repeated these motions like a piston. As they continued to merge their bodies together, their pleasure began to build up.
KyungHyun brought his lips to her earlobe and then moved them behind her ear to lick the tender skin. The last time they had sex, he learned that this spot was sensitive for her. However, the more he teased her there, the more aroused he became.
“Don’t do it so hard…!”

“Why not? You like it like that.”



“If you do it that hard, then it’ll leave a mark…Hnng!”
“If people know that I’m the one who left that mark, then all those bastards won’t dare stick so close to you.”
“Are… you doing this on purpose?”

“I can’t stand watching those sons of bitches drooling after my woman.”
“But I’m not your woman, Director.”

She wanted to keep a straight face, but as she felt him suck her skin, a surge of pleasure shot up her stomach.
“Whenever you’re having sex with me, you are my woman.”
KyungHyun slid his hand inside her dress and began to caress her back and her chest. Constrained by her bra, EunHa felt pleasure spread out through her body like electric currents.
“You won’t be able to think about anything else other than what we’re doing right now.”
“Don’t be… ridiculous…!”

As EunHa shook her head, KyungHyun buried his face even deeper into her neck.
“Let’s see if I’m being ridiculous or not.”

As his penis continued to throb inside her, the wet sounds of their mating grew louder and louder. Every time his cock rammed into her, his scrotum fiercely slapped against her bottom, making it turn red.
Having softened due to the stimulation, her walls welcomed its guest as it repeatedly contracted and relaxed around his penis. Glistening with their fluids, his cock disappeared then reappeared as



it pumped into her entrance.

“You said you didn’t want it, and yet you’re squeezing me so tight right now. Is this your MO?”
“How, hnng, did you know?”

“Seeing as how you’re still joking around, I see that I’m not working hard enough.”
Without taking off any of his clothes, KyungHyun began ramming into her with his pants and underwear lowered to his thighs. He had pinned her thighs back so that every time he thrust in, his pubic bone mercilessly hit her clitoris. EunHa couldn’t stand the sensations climbing up her body. He continued to violently rock in and out of her body.
“I think I’m going to come. Haaa, ah… I think I’m coming… Hnng!”
“Should I make you feel good?”

His perfectly styled hair had become disheveled, and a few locks fell onto his forehead. He whispered to her in a hoarse voice. EunHa felt as if she was already going crazy with pleasure now. How much more could he give her? Hazy with desire, she gasped for breath as she nodded her head.
“Yes, please do it…!”

KyungHyun tightly grabbed her squirming body. Then he began to focus his thrusts so that he continuously stimulated the upper portion of her entrance.
Thanks to their sexual encounter at her apartment two days ago, it seemed that KyungHyun had perfectly memorized her body. He knew where to touch her to make her moan. He knew where to thrust in order to bring her the greatest pleasure that brought tears to her



eyes. How else was he able to turn her into such a complete mess?

“Don’t come yet.”
“It isn’t something… I can… hnng…. control.”

She gazed at him with resentful eyes as she gasped for breath. Suddenly, KyungHyun put his hand underneath her hips and lifted her up on top of him.
“You haven’t ridden me yet.”

KyungHyun placed her on his lap and began to thrust up into her. Thankfully, they weren’t in the usual sedan, and the roof of the car was higher. If it weren’t for that, EunHa’s head would have definitely banged against the roof of the car. EunHa’s plump bottom began to bounce up and down above his cock.
“Hnng! Aaagh!”

KyungHyun continued to raise his hips as their skins slapped. Their fluids splattered in all directions, and EunHa’s eyes welled up with tears. It was just like the first time they had sex. The pleasure was so intense that she almost felt afraid.
“You like doing it this way.” “Ah, aaaah!”
As a tingling climax spread throughout her body, EunHa began to wriggle her hips as she moaned. Her panting breaths brushed over KyungHyun’s neck. Her entrance contracted due to the climax and milked KyungHyun’s penis. A groan burst out his lips.
“Huu, does it feel that good?” “Haa…”
EunHa looked down at KyungHyun and grabbed his cheek with a



trembling hand. She did this instinctively due to her sense of fear. She felt that if she didn’t do this, she would be completely dominated by this man.
With reddened eyes, she looked into the deep abyss of his eyes and lowered her head for a kiss. She sought his tongue and began to fiercely suck. KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed. EunHa unconsciously shut her eyes. She felt as if his eyes could read her mind, and she wanted to avoid his gaze in this moment.
“Open your eyes and look at me. Show me how much you feel it.”
“I don’t want to.”

She rejected his command and brushed his lips with her tongue. She kissed his face before burying her lips into his neck. She bit down hard into his neck and sucked, just like he had done to her earlier. She could smell his cologne mixed in with his manly scent. KyungHyun’s chest underneath his clothes felt taut and hard.
Still sitting on his lap, EunHa began to move her hips. KyungHyun’s chest suddenly rose up and down. The man’s arousal could clearly be seen on his face.
“Huu…”

He let out a husky moan and pressed his hand down on her hips.
“Haaagh…!”

His penis had reached so deep inside her that EunHa let out a cry. His large hand was restraining her, so she couldn’t escape. The veins throbbed in his neck as he ejaculated.
“Ah, hnng!”

He pulled back as if he was going to leave her, but then he thrust



back inside. Her body trembled. As he continued to spurt inside her, EunHa was trapped in his arms and couldn’t do anything else but moan.
They were finally finished having their combative bout of sex.
EunHa’s foggy mind began to clear.
“…Are you trying to get me pregnant?”

Completely exhausted, she asked KyungHyun in a reproachful voice.
“Haha, of course not.”

KyungHyun furrowed his brow and let out a faint laugh. Still inside his embrace, EunHa began to move as she tried to leave. KyungHyun shook his head.
“If you move now, it’ll all drip out and ruin your clothes.”

Just like he said, as soon as she moved, a cream-colored fluid began to leak out. Seeing their pubic hair stuck together due to their fluids, EunHa frowned.
“That looks crazy sexy.”

As if he read her thoughts, KyungHyun murmured in a husky voice. EunHa helplessly lowered herself onto his cock once again. and her breath hitched. Unlike last time, KyungHyun had ejaculated inside her.
“If I’m pregnant, you need to take responsibility.”

“Are you telling me that you want to have sex with me until you’re pregnant?”
KyungHyun reached into his pants pocket and took out a a packet of long pills inside a silver wrapper. EunHa frowned and snatched the



packet of contraceptive pills. She wondered when he had gotten ahold of this, but then she remembered how he had snuck the necklace into her purse.
“So you weren’t satisfied from just rummaging around someone’s purse. You had to steal too?”
“It would be troublesome if you were addicted to drugs, so I just needed to make sure.”
Even though she wasn’t in a position to rebuke someone for their terrible habits, EunHa couldn’t help but feel annoyed. She glared at him. She didn’t like how he looked so satisfied. Like a beast that had just returned from a successful hunt.
“Aren’t we in a hurry?” “Lie down for now.”
After laying her down, KyungHyun finally pulled out of her. Then he began to clean up the mess between her thighs, treating her carefully as if she were a child. EunHa tried to stop him, but he was stubborn.
“I’ll get changed. Thankfully, we bought two dresses.”

She was about to take out the fluttering cream-colored dress from its paper bag, but KyungHyun stopped her.
“No, this dress suits you much better.” “…Every dress suits me.”
“Don’t twist my words. I like the one you’re wearing right now.”
“Why?”

It was true that he had extravagant tastes. As EunHa pondered



this, KyungHyun calmly answered her.

“This dress smells of sex. It’ll distract me from the boring party, so I think it’ll make the time go by faster.”
“Director, I’m sorry to say this, but…” EunHa spoke with a bitter expression on her face. “Say it.”
“Has anyone told you that you have strange sexual preferences?”
“No.”

“How strange. I wonder why no one told you. The comment you made just now makes you sound like an absolute pervert.”
When EunHa stressed the word ‘pervert’, KyungHyun laughed softly. At the strangely friendly atmosphere, EunHa coughed awkwardly.
“There wasn’t a woman who could say something like that to my face. Until now.”
“Mm… Then do I need to risk death and strike you across the cheek?”
“What do you mean?”

“When a sharp-looking man like you tells a woman that she’s the first to do anything, it usually means that he’s falling in love.”
KyungHyun’s face strangely went stiff before a loud laugh burst out of his lips. Raising his chin as he laughed, KyungHyun looked like he was truly laughing and having a good time. Was it that funny? EunHa



blinked her large eyes.

“Do you want to strike my face once and see? Let’s see what will happen.”
“I’ll have to reject your offer. I don’t want to die before I turn thirty.”
“Good thinking.”

Still chuckling, KyungHyun opened the car window and called the driver who was standing 10 meters away. The driver wore sunglasses as he entered back inside. He seemed to have smelled the lingering scent of sex and hesitated before smoothly driving them away.
It seemed that this was how KyungHyun was announcing to everyone that he had made the new recruit of the secretarial department his woman. If he didn’t want his plans to be ruined, it was better off this way. Insects were always attracted to beautiful flowers, and the Lee EunHa at his side was definitely a seductive woman.
KyungHyun gazed at EunHa’s profile as she looked out the window. She was lost in thought. KyungHyun wanted to know how the sixteen-year-old EunHa had fallen into the clutches of Kang SungHo. How had she become one of Serim’s people? He read the report that he had received a few days ago, but all he could find was that Kang SungHo had thoroughly hid her from outsiders.
It wasn’t impossible. She was just a young girl when she had been kidnapped. He couldn’t cross out the possibility that she might have been hypnotized or exposed to violence, causing her to become brainwashed. Living abroad and operating in foreign countries, no one would know that this female member of Serim was actually the missing Lee EunHa.
What should he do now?



EunHa felt his intense gaze and turned her head. She gave him a silent grin.
“I understand that you’re quite fond of me, but…” “…But?”
“If you keep looking at me like that, I feel like you’re going to drill a hole into my face.”
“How cold-hearted.”

“I didn’t say anything that bad.”

If Kang SungHo had truly ordered her to kill him, then she was going to attack him soon. KyungHyun thought that it might be for the best. If she revealed her sharp claws in front of him, KyungHyun felt that things would get a lot easier. If she wanted to scratch him, he was even willing to present his back to her. If it would make her trust him, he’d do it.
“You’re pretty.”

Holding her gaze, KyungHyun apathetically opened his mouth.
“…I know.”

“Are you bored of hearing that so often?” KyungHyun gazed at her calm expression as he asked. “Well, I guess so, but also…”
“Also?”

“They say that a beauty’s fate is filled with misfortune.
Many beauties in history haven’t met a very good end.” “It’s because they all met foolish men.”



EunHa’s shoulders trembled as she laughed in disbelief.

“Why are you laughing?” “Do you really think that?”
When KyungHyun glanced at her from the corner of his eye, EunHa let out an exclamation of wonder.
“Wow. You’re really macho.”

KyungHyun frowned. He wasn’t sure if that good or bad. When he saw EunHa’s giggling face, he realized that it was probably the latter. Not knowing how to answer her, he kept his lips shut.
As their car raced down the road, KyungHyun realized why Kang SungHo had sent her instead of his many other underlings. Kang SungHo knew without a doubt that Lee EunHa’s strength was making a man become obsessed with her. KyungHyun suddenly felt something hot rise up inside him.
“…What’s the matter?”

When she heard KyungHyun curse, EunHa asked him with wide eyes.
“Do you hate hearing me call you macho that much?” “…Yeah.”
“I really like macho men.”

KyungHyun’s serious expression relaxed, and he let out a sigh. He forced his eyes off of her pretty smile. The desire to quickly finish this project grew greater and greater. This was the first time he had wanted to reveal his true identity to someone and approach them honestly.
“We’ve arrived.”



Just as KyungHyun had reached a conclusion on what to do next, the car had arrived at their destination. EunHa had opened the car door and was just about to exit the car when KyungHyun grabbed her hand. The necklace suited EunHa perfectly as it sparkled on her chest.
“Should we head inside?” “Yes, Director.”
An 8-story building stood in front of them. It didn’t seem to fit in with the abandoned factories around it. A colorless sign coldly stated that this dark building was a wedding hall. In some ways, it looked like an abandoned motel. Because it didn’t have a parking lot, a group of black sedans were parked in an empty lot outside.
EunHa didn’t hesitate as she stepped into the place where all the YongSung members had gathered. Her long hair flew in the chilly wind.







90% of the guests at the KeumOh founding part were obviously YongSung gangsters. They were all wearing black suits as if it was a uniform and had thug-like faces. They might as well have stuck signs on their foreheads that said ‘I am a gangster’.
The gangsters of YongSung and the drug traffickers all had distinctive features that set them apart from the normal employees who worked in front of computers in the KeumOh office building. Having seen enough of these kinds of people at Serim, EunHa wasn’t scared. She was merely struck with awe as all these men lowered their heads when KyungHyun passed by.
“Straighten my tie for me.”

After sitting down at their table, KyunHyun looked around the room and took a sip of wine. Then he lowered his head to EunHa’s ear.
“It looks fine.”

EunHa distanced herself from him a little before tilting her head. KyungHyun clicked his tongue and brought his head close to hers once again.
“Just do as I say.”

EunHa helplessly straightened his tie and his shirt collar. She glanced at the white, folded handkerchief in his breast pocket. She recalled where it had been used and felt a rush of embarrassment flood over her.
“Can’t you please take this out?”



“Didn’t you tell me that it was gentlemanly for a man to carry around a handkerchief?”
“But it isn’t supposed to be used for that.”

“Why is it okay to use it to clean your face but not other places?”
KyungHyun gave her a languid smile. A few days ago, when KyungHyun had used his handkerchief to wipe the dirt off her face, EunHa had called him a gentleman. If she could take back her words now, she would have.
Even though they had sex in the car just moments ago, KyungHyun kept a straight face as he greeted the guests. As expected, EunHa merely smiled prettily like a mannequin and played her role at his side. Instead of his secretary, EunHa felt as if she were playing the role of Shin KyungHyun’s woman. It was a strange feeling, but she couldn’t show her discomfort.
All the men’s glances that had come her way subsided in an instant when she sat down next to KyungHyun. They didn’t even greet her. While it was refreshing to be treated like an invisible person, it also blocked any opportunity for her to approach someone else to obtain more information. EunHa smiled bitterly.
“Good work, Hyung-nim.”

A man lowered his head and spoke in a country accent. KyungHyun raised his liquor glass in the man’s direction.
“I also heard that you’ve been through a lot lately.”

“I shouldn’t have used part-timers in the first place. Who knew those young bastards would take the gold and run? I heard they’re in prison right now, but I’m thinking of tightening the screws on them as soon as they get out.”



“It’ll be dangerous, so stay low for now. I heard there’s been an emergency in the Japanese customs, so they’re cracking down pretty hard.”
“Yes, sir. I wanted to thank you for blocking the efforts of those bastards at the Yamamoto-gumi…”
“It’s fine. Don’t worry about any of that and just eat and drink before heading back down.”
Many more men took turns coming up to KyungHyun’s table and bowed their heads. Sitting next to him, EunHa held her champagne flute and ate her food as she looked around the room.
Even though it was formally called a founding party, everyone here was eating and joking around noisily. Korean food and western food, Chinese food and Japanese food. The cuisines of many different countries continued to be brought out haphazardly. Tables were full of wine, soju, whiskey, beer, rice wine, sake, and kaoliang liquor.
The chandelier sparkled, and the elegant banquet hall was filled with cigarette smoke. Instead of classical music, the sexy song of a popular girl group was playing inside this sophisticated space.
This atmosphere didn’t seem to match the gloomy wedding hall situated in the middle of the ruins of a construction site. It also didn’t seem to suit the sparkling KeumOh building that stood in the middle of Gangnam either.
“Hyung-nim! Let me pour you another glass!”

KyungHyun didn’t reject his underlings’ offer and received it. As time passed by, the atmosphere in the room began to lift.
“How it it? What is your impression of our company’s founding party?”
KyungHyun shrugged his shoulders as he watched EunHa take a



bite of the slice of cake next to the salmon sushi.

“I can’t tell if it’s a picnic or a party, but I don’t think it’s bad at all. Everyone seems to be having a good time.”
“Really?”

“Yes. I thought the president would come out and give a speech, but it seems that he isn’t. That’s a bit surprising.”
KyungHyun moistened his throat with some liquor as he listened to her indifferent voice.
“Didn’t I tell you before? The president doesn’t come out in public very often.”
“But isn’t today a bit more important than usual?”

“A few years ago, at a party where all the gangsters were gathered together, someone brandished a knife.”
Eunha looked at him and silently swallowed. In this moment, she was about to hear whether the rumors were true.
“…Who was the attacker?”

She wanted to grab this person by the throat and ask why he couldn’t kill him with one stroke of the blade. But she suppressed this urge and asked cautiously.
“The president’s nephew. In other words, it was a coup d’état.”
“…And he ultimately failed.”

“Yeah. I got stabbed instead, and, with the knife still lodged in me, I killed the guy.”
EunHa’s eyes silently trembled. Looking into her eyes, KyungHyun



put a cigarette into his mouth and lit the lighter with a click. EunHa’s view became cloudy as the cigarette smoke slowly flowed out of his mouth. KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed as he spoke in a low voice.
“Thanks to him, I made it all the way up here.” “…I see.”
“If you risk your life, most people will trust you.”
“…So you’re saying that in order to gain your trust, one would have to risk their life.”
KyungHyun took a deep drag of the cigarette and chuckled.

“And what would you do after having gained my trust?”

“I don’t know. I don’t think I want to go through the trouble of obtaining it.”
EunHa let out a refreshing laugh and raised her liquor glass.

“I’m someone who values her life more than anything else.”
“That’s good.”

KyungHyun raised his own glass and clinked it against hers. His gaze on her seemed to grow deeper. Without looking away from her, he downed the liquor in his glass in one go.
“Director.”

General Manager Cha, who had been sitting at another table, came over to them and bowed.
“The room has been prepared.”

EunHa pretended to be disinterested and glanced away. However,



she read General Manager Cha’s lips as he whispered to KyungHyun.
“It’s about the matter at Shenzhen…”

KyungHyun glanced over at EunHa, and she quickly placed her eyes back on her plate. He straightened his clothes and got up from his seat.
“I’ll be right back, so wait here.” “Yes, sir. I’ll do that.”
EunHa obediently nodded her head. She pretended to be calm, but her heart was rapidly beating inside her chest. She had definitely heard General Manager Cha say ‘Shenzhen.’
Shenzhen, China. This was where the medical headquarters was located. This was where they were developing the new drug. Even inside KeumOh, this project was kept top-secret, so it was difficult to find any information on it. No matter what, she needed to eavesdrop on this conversation.
“Let’s go.”

KyungHyun took General Manager Cha and exited the venue. EunHa sat at the table by herself and sipped her wine. Then she pretended to go to the bathroom and got up. The corridor was full of men passing through, and the lights flickered on the walls. General Manager Cha and KyungHyun had disappeared and were nowhere to be found. In order to avoid any attention, she went to the bathroom. She turned on the faucet and washed her hands.
“Where is the Boss? Shouldn’t he be here to raise the atmosphere a little? He’s having Director Shin do everything for him. What if something goes wrong? I don’t know what he can be thinking, seriously.”
“Things have been looking good for Director Shin. I’m



almost certain Director Im went down to Busan because he couldn’t stand to see it any longer.”
“Makes sense. Not that long ago, everyone crawled on their knees whenever Director Im said anything. But now that Director Shin is treating him like an underling, it’s weird to see.”
“Hey, you bastard. Now that Director Im isn’t here, look who’s talking big. If you go around talking like that, you’ll vanish off the face of the earth one day, you idiot.”
“A guy saw Director Im before he left for Busan and told me.”
She could hear the drunk voice coming from the men’s restroom next door. The subject of their discussion, Director Im, was the former deputy director in charge of Busan and Kyungnam.
When she had been gathering information about YongSung, she found that this man had the most men under his authority before KyungHyun had taken power. Even though the profits gained from his nightclubs and show business ventures had gradually shrunk, many still followed him in the name of old glory.
“Still, how can he not show up on a day like this?”

“If Director Im came, would he or Director Shin be able to fully enjoy themselves?”
“I guess so. Since Boss isn’t even here, I guess there’s no point in spoiling the mood.”
Anyone could tell that KyungHyun and Director Im didn’t get along very well within YongSung. After storing this piece of information inside her head, EunHa exited the bathroom. It wouldn’t be good if she ran into another gangster when KyungHyun was gone. She began to quickly walk away when she heard the other man’s voice



ring in her ears.

“I don’t know. I think Boss might be here.” “What bullshit are you saying now?” EunHa stopped dead in her tracks.
“He might not be up out front, but he’ll probably be watching everything through a screen. I heard it from our hyung-nim, so I’m pretty sure that’s the case.”
“Why is he hiding around like a cop? It’s not like he’s watching us play around.”
“I told you to fucking watch your mouth. It’s because he’s that careful that our organization is still aﬂoat, you bastard. If not for him, those Serim sons of bitches would have infiltrated by now and killed us all.”
The men’s voices came closer, so EunHa went back and hid behind the bathroom wall. Her heart began to beat loudly. If what they said was true, then the head of YongSung was currently in the same building as her. She tried to calm down by telling herself that there was a chance it wasn’t true.
“I’ll be right back, so wait here.”

She recalled what KyungHyun had said. If he had to get up from his seat to meet someone, then it meant that this person had to have a high position. It couldn’t hurt to make sure. EunHa left the bathroom. Instead of heading back to the banquet hall, she silently began to walk around the first floor.
Even though there were may event venues on this floor, all the doors were locked. She couldn’t hear anything inside these rooms either. Was she mistaken? EunHa pondered this as she walked back to the banquet hall. She walked towards the back entrance and saw



that the party venue was still noisy and full of cigarette smoke. She still couldn’t see any sight of KyungHyun.
“……”

She stopped in her tracks. A red ‘X’ was sprayed onto the iron doors of an old elevator to indicate that it wasn’t operating. However, she saw someone push a cart inside and disappear.
There was no way someone outside of YongSung was in this building. All the gangsters were gathered in the banquet hall on the 1st floor.
There was no reason for the female employee to be pushing a bar cart full of liquor anywhere else. After the elevator doors closed, EunHa quickly found the emergency staircase.
Holding her high heels in her hand, she ran upstairs. Pant. Pant. She needed to move faster than the elevator in order to find out which floor it was going to.
3rd floor. 5th floor. 8th floor.
Damn it. Was this all because she had picked the Wheel of Fortune card at a tarot stand at the beginning of the year? Was it a sign that the wheel would continue to turn until her death? EunHa felt that she had been running constantly since Hong Kong. Just when she almost lost her breath and her legs had become tense from all the blood rushing to it, the elevator finally stopped with a ding.
“Haa…Haa…”

Just as the doors opened, EunHa quickly hid in the stairwell and panted silently. The corridor was absolutely silent. Afraid that her



rapidly beating heart would be heard, EunHa took in a deep breath and closed her mouth. The female employee pushed the cart across the dirty carpet of the corridor and finally stopped in front of a door at the end. She knocked on the closed door. EunHa’s eyes narrowed in the darkness.
A familiar face answered. It was the face of General Manager Cha, who had disappeared together with KyungHyun. This meant that KyungHyun was in there as well.
The female employee pushed the cart full of liquor inside, and after about 5 minutes, she came back out. The employee got back on the elevator, and EunHa waited for the doors to close shut. She slowly exited the stairwell and stepped into the corridor. A long sign with ‘SECURITY’ written across it was hanging next to the closed door. She could smell the faint scent of cigarette smoke coming from inside the room.
“When did you say you were leaving the country?”

She could hear the faint voice of a man. EunHa lowered the sound of her breaths and brought her ear closer to the door.
“In one month, sir.”

“I expect the factory to run at full speed now.”

“It will, sir. I’ve already told them that they won’t get any money if the drugs aren’t of the same quality as the samples. And they don’t want to lose a customer who will want to purchase their product in bulk.”
“As expected, we need to see it with our own eyes when it comes to this amount. It’s not like we’re running a charity here.”
“I think it’ll be dangerous for you to come to the site, sir.”



“I’ll have you there with me, Director Shin, so what do I have to worry about?”
EunHa couldn’t completely understand what they were talking about. She got even closer to the door and stuck her ear up against it as she frowned. The conversation continued on.
“And there’s no issues with customs?”

“Yes, sir. After the ship departed from Shenzhen, it was scheduled to go through Hong Kong before coming to us. I’ve already met with Kim MinSuk and guaranteed that we won’t be facing any obstacles.”
“Make sure no one catches a whiff of it and comes running over. The men who are the best at smelling money are the ones in politics.”
“We’ve already obtained the medical contract, so they won’t be able to say anything.”
EunHa heard a someone’s low laughter.
“As expected, those Chinese bastards… Who else could have thought to establish a medical company in order to legally sell medical methamphetamines? And not even domestically but internationally.
EunHa’s expression stiffened.

“They declare themselves to be a research lab but boldly produce ice by the tons. Who could have imagined something like that?”
Methamphetamines. In slang, it was called bbong, ice. Black ice. Philopon.



EunHa’s pupils dilated immediately. Her mouth went dry at this unexpected information. Her heart began to race as it had when she had run up the stairs.
If what they said was true, then SungHo had completely misunderstood the situation. The new medicine that Shin KyungHyun was developing was all fake. In actuality, they were planning on smuggling in a huge amount of drugs into the country. She now realized the true reason why KyungHyun had met with Kim MinSuk. By appeasing him, they had managed to find a way to get through customs and pave a path for their shipment to come through.
“If those hyena bastards at Serim realize what’s going on, they’ll come after us with their eyes wide open, so be careful.”
“I’ll take care of that, sir. Leave it to me.”

KyungHyun wasn’t wrong. Once SungHo knew the truth, they’d have to modify their plans. That greedy man would definitely try to snatch this away. This wasn’t something she could do on her own. She needed to get out of here and quickly let SungHo know what was really going on. EunHa’s hands were damp with sweat.
“One more thing, Director Shin.” “What is it, sir?”
“I don’t see the woman who came with you to the party venue on the screen.”
Damn it. EunHa swallowed, her mouth dry. She needed to get back to her seat before KyungHyun went searching for her.
“But I see that she’s been caught doing something useless on this ﬂoor’s corridor camera.”
EunHa quickly lifted her head and clearly saw the security camera



on the ceiling.
“…Let me go out and take a look, sir.”

There was no time to think. Just as she was about to run away, someone burst out of the room. She bit the inside of her cheeks and swallowed a curse.
“What’s going on?”

She looked up at the large man in front of her and blinked her eyes, fluttering her eyelashes, as she put a confused expression on her face.
“I came up to take in some fresh air on the roof, but I heard voices coming from here. Sorry.”
“You fucking bitch. Get inside for now.”

The moment the man snatched her neck, EunHa didn’t hesitate and kicked his groin with all her might.
“Omo, what do you think you’re doing?!” “Uugh!”
The large man grabbed his groin and let out a low groan. He still managed to grab her arm and dragged her into the room.
“Let me go. My shoes are coming off…!”

Her voice became shrill as it got louder. She tried to catch her balance as she gave another kick. Behind the large frame of the man, she saw a middle-aged man sitting in the back of the room.
“……!”

This was the man whose photo she had seen so many times that she had lost count. YongSung’s president, the man who had ordered



her family to be massacred. This man was gazing at her. to him, KyungHyun and General Manager Cha were frowning in surprise as they approached her. However, in EunHa’s eyes, only Noh HyungChul existed.
Her mouth went dry, and her face turned as white as sheet. Tears glistened in her eyes like glass beads.
“…You fucking bitch!” “Stop!”
Just as the man was about to hit her, KyungHyun yelled out. EunHa didn’t waste the opportunity that presented itself as the man hesitated. She grabbed the gun that had been lodged inside the waistband of his pants and took it out. The moment she saw Noh HyungChul’s face, everything she had worked for had finally settled into place. Now all she had to do was kill the man who had killed her parents with her own hands.
Bang!

She didn’t have time to think before she pulled the trigger. Due to her trembling hands, the bullet missed its target and lodged itself in one of the screens behind Noh HyungChul. EunHa’s pulse began to race faster. YongSung’s head looked at her and let out a relaxed laugh.
“…How can such a pretty lady hold such a dangerous thing.”
“Go spew your bullshit in hell.”

EunHa’s finger tensed as she was about to pull the trigger once again.
“Lower the gun.”



She felt something touch her temple. KyungHyun was at her side as he aimed his gun at her. EunHa’s lips turned blue as her face paled.
“Seeing as how a rookie like her was stuck to your side… It seems that our Director Shin is finished as well.”
Hot tears dripped down EunHa’s cheeks. Seeing Noh HyungChul laugh as he scratched his white beard, EunHa felt as if her heart was burning with rage.
“Lower your gun. Now!”

KyungHyun spoke softly once again. EunHa looked at the screen showing the surveillance recording of the party venue. After hearing the gunshot, the gangsters suddenly halted in their tracks and began to leave the room in a hoard. This was YongSung’s base. Having shot a bullet at its leader, she was as good as dead anyways.
EunHa’s cloudy eyes narrowed as she smiled at her target. It wasn’t difficult to settle her heart. It was just like she practiced all those times at the shooting range.
“Lee EunHa!”

Bang! Bang! “Uuugh!”
The moment she pulled the trigger, Noh HyungChul’s fallen bodyguard fired his gun at her from behind. In one moment, two bullets left its respective guns as the sound rang in the room. EunHa felt a burning sensation run through her shoulder. The gun she had been holding fell to the floor. As she fell down, she saw Noh HyungChul grab his chest as he collapsed.



“Get away from her, Director Shin!”

The bodyguard yelled out as KyungHyun crouched over EunHa’s fallen body. The bodyguard couldn’t shoot freely because KyungHyun was too close to her.
“Damn it…”

KyungHyun cursed through his teeth and raised his gun as he took aim.
Bang! Bang!

He shot at the lights on the ceiling and completely destroyed them. The room was suddenly enveloped in darkness. KyungHyun covered EunHa’s body and began to fire several shots inside the room.
“What’s going on?!”

The door burst open, and the gangsters began to flood into the room. Bang! Bang! As the sound of shots rang inside the room, the gangster’s cries followed as they collapsed. As the windows shattered and the bottles of liquor crashed, an array of glass fragments shot out in every direction.
In the midst of all this pandemonium, EunHa began to crawl. She was in so much pain that she could barely breathe. Hot blood drenched her dress as it flowed out. A few seconds later, a silence settled inside the room. KyungHyun lit his lighter with a click.
Bang! Bang!

As the light cut through the darkness, KyungHyun fired his gun again, and two more men collapsed.
“Uugh!”

KyungHyun grabbed her and softly yelled out.



“Stay awake, Lee EunHa… Lee EunHa!”
General Manager Cha quickly rushed over to KyungHyun’s side and hurriedly asked.
“What should we do?”

She could hear General Manager Cha’s voice. KyungHyun gave him an order in a low voice.
“Get Lee EunHa out of here. I’ll take care of the rest.” “Yes, sir.”
She was being lifted onto someone’s back. Her blood dripped down constantly as they went down the emergency staircase. The image of the blood-drenched 2nd floor carpet of her house kept overlapping with her vision.
“EunHa… No… Don’t come…!”

Recalling her mother’s eyes wet with blood, EunHa closed her eyes and lost consciousness.
TN: Hmm… What are you doing, KH?  Sorry for the cliffhanger! In the next update, we’ll delve into EunHa’s past and the traumatic event that shaped who she is.






– Hey, Lee. Isn’t it dangerous to be out this late at night?
Amy, EunHa’s best friend, sounded worried. Having talked for so long, EunHa’s phone felt hot in her hand. She looked down at it and frowned.
[Yeah, my battery’s about to die anyways. I think I need to head back now.] – That’s probably for the best. When did you say you were coming back again? [If it were up to me, I would ﬂy back as soon as possible. No matter what, I’m going to do everything I can to get on the plane next week. You’ll be the first to know when the exact date has been decided.]
EunHa let out a deep sigh and scratched her head. She wanted to hang out with her friends, but as soon as her school break had started, she had to fly to Korea. She didn’t like this from the start. Because she was the only Asian at school, she was treated like an alien sometimes, but thanks to her personality, she managed to make new friends fairly quickly.
– Okay. Jason asked about you. He was checking to see if Lee was going camping with us.
On top of that, she even had a crush who made her heart race everyday. A blush formed on her face as she thought about Jason’s smile. Because he was the school quarterback, he was popular at school.
[Ah, really?] – It looked like he was really looking forward to seeing you there. [Amy, I’m going to look up plane tickets as



soon as I get home.] – You need to persuade your parents first since they’re very strict, Lee. [If they don’t give me their permission, I’m going to tell them that I’m going to sneak off to Philadelphia and join a female gang.] – A female gang? I’ve never heard of those before. [Of course you haven’t. I’m going to establish the first one.] – Haha, as expected of you, Lee. You’re so much fun.
Amy’s laugh made EunHa burst into laughter as well. She finally let out a soft sigh.
[Emily’s older sister said she’d go as the chaperone, so I don’t know why my parents were so against it. I mean, I knew they were strict, but I don’t think there are parents out there in the world that are more strict than mine. At times like these, I wish I was an orphan.] – Don’t get too worked up and try to persuade them. Good luck. [Okay. I might call you again later.]
After they said their goodbyes, EunHa ended the call. EunHa begrudgingly began to walk back to her house. The houses in this neighborhood were lined up along the slope and had tall walls. Her house was the one at the very end of the street.
EunHa complained in her heart with every step. Ever since she was young, her parents were very protective of her. ‘Strict’ didn’t even cut it. Ever since elementary school, her mother always waited for her at the school gates at the end of every school day. If EunHa wanted to go over to friend’s house, she always needed to get her parents’ permission beforehand.
When she was in 5th grade, she moved to the United States. Her father stayed behind to work in Korea, so EunHa felt a little bad leaving him, but EunHa was excited to finally have some breathing room of her own.
While she was in the United States, a Mexican woman was hired to



take care of her. The woman was funny and kind. The other children were wary of her at first, but they were all nice.
Since she was the only Asian in the neighborhood, she always stood out whenever she went out. However, her life was less restricted here than in Korea. Therefore, whenever she returned to Korea during her breaks, her parents’ overprotection seemed even more severe to her.
After finally reaching her house, EunHa made up her mind. She was going to let them know how she felt no matter what. She took out the round sensor key and held it up.
What the…
The front gate was slightly open. EunHa frowned. Did she forget to close it properly when she left? As she pondered this, she went inside and closed the gate. She carefully lifted her feet as she walked. There was no sign of their family dog, Fluffy. The hunting dog was usually very energetic and always wanted to play. It was past midnight now, so maybe he didn’t want to get up.
EunHa fidgeted with Fluffy’s treat inside her pocket as she made her way across the yard. The moon was hidden behind the clouds tonight. The neighborhood seemed quieter than usual. Maybe it was due to the time of night.
“……”

The front door was open, and there was dim light coming from the living room. EunHa’s frown became even deeper. Something was wrong. Did her parents find out that she had snuck out of the house?
Her mother always woke up throughout the night and opened her bedroom door to check up on her, so it was a possibility. That’s why EunHa had thrown her teddy bear underneath the sheets before she left. But it seemed that it wasn’t enough and she’d been caught.



She was going to get a good scolding as soon as she went inside. EunHa was sure of it. And this was all after she had just argued with them about the camping trip. EunHa knew what she was going to say.
How long were they going to keep treating her like a child?

EunHa mumbled to herself and took off her shoes. She tossed the keys into the basket next to the door. Then she turned into the decorated corridor. She was imagining the looks on her parents’ faces as they sat on the sofa in the living room. Just as she was about to turn into the lit room…
“……!”

EunHa quickly hid behind the cupboard. She covered her mouth with both hands because she couldn’t stop her teeth from trembling. She bit the inside her cheeks very hard as she tried to mute the noise.
Robbers.

She saw someone in black go up the stairs. She felt as if her heard had jumped up to the back of her throat as it pounded inside her chest.
‘What… What do I do…?’

A robber had definitely broken into the house. The house had a private security system installed. If someone was monitoring the situation through the security cameras, they would be sending help within 5 minutes.
Her mother had collected priceless paintings and ceramic works and spread them throughout the house. It would take the robber more than 5 minutes to take all of it.
EunHa believed that all she needed to do was wait for the security



guards to come. Suddenly, she heard a cry come from the room connected to the living room.
“Aaagh! Wh-Who… are you… Aaaagh!”

EunHa’s pupils dilated. While she was in the United States, she had always talked to her father at least once a day, so there was no way she didn’t recognize his voice. Her tears flowed down her hands that were still covering her mouth. This man wasn’t simply a robber.
She needed to get out. She needed to run away right now, but her legs had turned to stone and wouldn’t move.
“Aaaagh!”

EunHa’s head shot up. She heard her mother’s scream followed by something crashing and stumbling onto the floor.
“Haaagh! Aaaagh!”

Every time EunHa heard the desperate wails of her mother, her heart skipped a beat and trembled. Her mind went blank, and she couldn’t think.
“Hm…Hmm…”

EunHa’s cries leaked through her hands as they continued to cover her mouth. She needed to hold it back. She was so scared that she didn’t even realize that her cellphone was in her pocket. EunHa didn’t move one step and continued to hide behind the cupboard.
“Hyung-nim, it’s done.” “There should be a kid on the 2nd ﬂoor.”
A door opened and someone walked out. EunHa shut her eyes. Mom, Dad. What am I supposed to do now? I’m scared. I’m scared!
I’m scared!



“There was no one else. The kid’s mother was the only one.” “It’s summer break, so she should still be in the house. She might have hid after hearing all the noise.”
EunHa trembled as she kept her eyes shut. How could this be happening to her family? A shiver went down her spine. This definitely wasn’t a dream.
Mom, Dad. Save me. What do I do?

“Have you checked under the bed? Inside the closet?” “Ah, that is… The mother wouldn’t cooperate…”
Tssk. EunHa heard someone click his tongue.

“I’ll go with you.”

She heard their footsteps on the carpet. EunHa’s face was covered in tears and snot and was a complete mess. She finally stepped out from behind the cupboard.
“…Haah!”

The carpet that her mother had cherished was drenched in blood. Her mother was collapsed on top of the stairs. Red blood flowed out endlessly from her mother’s body and dripped down the stairs.
“M…M…Mo…!”

EunHa held out a trembling hand towards her mother. Her frozen legs finally moved. She took a step closer to her mother. Even though her eyes were blurry with tears, she finally saw her hand grab her mother’s.
‘Don’t… come… EunHa…’

Her mother’s face was warped with pain. She didn’t make a sound and only moved her lips at EunHa. She could hear the men



ransacking her room as they flipped all the furniture.
“M…Mom…” “Go… Run… EunHa, run…”

Her mother barely managed to speak. She coughed and some blood burst out of her lips. EunHa watched her mother die with her eyes still open and collapsed onto the floor.
“She’s not in the bathroom either. Just how many bathrooms are in this damn house? Just how much money did they blow through all these years?” “Keep searching the 2nd ﬂoor. I’ll go back downstairs and check there.”
EunHa heard the steady footsteps go down the stairs. When she heard the squeaking shoes on the hardwood floor, her chin began to tremble. She grit her teeth and bit her cheek as she crawled into the master bedroom. She didn’t have enough time to run across the living room and reach the front door.
“Uugh…!”

Her father was spread out on the bed, drenched in blood. He wasn’t moving. His red blood had spread throughout the white sheets and was dripping onto floor, making a small puddle. EunHa gripped her hair so tight that it felt like she was ripping it out of her scalp. She didn’t understand how this could be happening to her. If this was a nightmare, she prayed that she would wake up. Please. Please!
Ding-dong.

Suddenly, her cellphone in her pocket let out an alarm. Terrified out of her wits, she grabbed her cellphone and pulled it out.
“Haa… Ah…”

With trembling hands, she turned off the phone. But it was too late. It seemed that the man outside had heard. The footsteps came closer. Suddenly, she heard a door burst open. One by one, the man



opened the door to her father’s study, then the guest room, then the dressing room. EunHa tightly gripped the cellphone and trembled.
Dad… Save me… Save me, Dad…
Finally, the master bedroom door opened. EunHa pressed her back against the wall behind the door. She bit her lips and held her breath.
“Maybe I misheard. Shit.”

She heard a man’s voice behind the intricately carved wooden door. If she was caught now, she’d die. EunHa continued to hold her breath. Each moment felt like an eternity.
“Where is our princess hiding…”

Her tears silently dripped down her cheeks. EunHa couldn’t even blink. EunHa heard a ringing sound as the man let go of the doorknob. When she heard the footsteps fade away, she rushed over to the bedroom window. There was no time to waste. If she stayed here any longer, she’d die.
“Huuu…”

EunHa held back her cries and tried her best to quietly open the window. As she was about to go over the windowsill, the moonlight shone over her father’s closed eyes and illuminated his body. A family portrait of her father, her mother, and EunHa hung on the wall.
Mom, Dad…!
EunHa tightly shut her eyes and jumped out the window. When her feet landed on the ground, she felt a spark of pain go through her ankle. However, if she stayed here, she’d be stabbed to death.
EunHa got up and ran across the yard with all her might. She now saw Fluffy’s legs poking out of his doghouse.



“Huu… Ugh…”
As soon as she ran out the gate, a sob escaped her lips, but she still couldn’t cry out as loud as she wanted to. With tears pouring out of her eyes, EunHa ran down the slope. There was no one on the slope surrounded by tall walls. She just needed to reach a major street. Just get to a major street…!
As she ran, someone popped out of an alleyway. EunHa crashed into this person.
“Aagh…!”

Just as EunHa was about to tumble down, the person firmly grabbed her shoulder. It was a tall young man wearing a black cap.
“Huu… Save… Save me…” EunHa clung onto him and sobbed. “Please… Please, save me…”
Her body wavered like an aspen tree. She begged him in a whispering voice as she wet her pants. She fainted, and when she opened her eyes, she was in the hospital.





EunHa’s eyes burst open. Tears were running down from her eyes.

“Are you awake?”

A tired woman was sitting by her side. She got up and approached EunHa.
“…Where am I?”

EunHa frowned as an unfamiliar voice left her throat. When she tried to move, her whole body throbbed and ached as if she had been beaten all over. EunHa let out a soft groan. The unfamiliar woman kept her eyes on EunHa as she made a call.
“Lee EunHa-ssi is awake.”

EunHa looked around with hazy eyes. EunHa was currently in a dull room that barely had any furniture. She thought she was in a hospital when she saw the IV in her arm, but the white clothes she was wearing didn’t have a hospital logo.
“Tell me. Where am I?”

EunHa looked at the unfamiliar woman and asked again.

“You’re in a hotel.”

The woman was wearing a short dress and had a lot of makeup on. Her flashy clothes didn’t seem to match her manner of speech and facial expression, but EunHa felt that she was telling the truth.
“What happened?”



The moment EunHa asked this question, the door opened and a man in a suit came inside holding a briefcase. He put the briefcase on the room-service tray and began to take out medical instruments.
“How do you feel?”

The man didn’t look like a doctor, but he held up an instrument to measure her blood pressure as he asked. When EunHa didn’t respond, he spoke up.
“Thankfully, the gunshot wound hit your shoulder, so it didn’t wound any organs. You’ve had surgery, so please don’t move your right arm until everything heals. Let me take a look at the wound.”
The unfamiliar woman, who had been standing silently to the side, came up and began to unbutton EunHa’s clothes and lowered it to reveal one shoulder. EunHa tilted her head and saw that her shoulder was wrapped in bandages.
“I’ll change the bandages.”

Whenever the man moved his hands, she felt a cold prickle of pain run through her arm, but it allowed her hazy mind to gradually clear up.
EunHa began to go through the events that she still remembered. Before she lost consciousness, she was attending YongSung’s founding party. She followed KyungHyun and eavesdropped on his conversation.
Drugs. She had overheard that they were smuggling in Philopon and had gotten caught in the process. She was just about to run away when… She saw Noh HyungChul. And she shot him. At the same time, she’d been shot as well. The room had gone dark and chaos ensued. She had been carried out of the building by someone, and that was all she remembered.



Click.

The man finally finished dressing her wound and wrapped it in bandages. He took out a syringe and a small, glass medicine bottle. EunHa shook her head.
“No.”

“I need to inject the antibiotics.”

“How can I trust that you’re going to give me antibiotics?”

Click. The door opened. EunHa turned her head to see KyungHyun enter the room.
“If we didn’t plan to treat you, we wouldn’t have given you surgery in the first place.”
EunHa stared at him silently with her pale face.

“How do you feel?”

KyungHyun asked her. EunHa continued to stare at him blankly before she pried open her dry lips.
“How did you know my name?”

KyungHyun merely stared back at her. He didn’t reply.

“When I fell after being shot, you called me ‘Lee EunHa’.” “……”
“And that woman also said my name when she called someone on the phone.”
When KyungHyun continued to stare at her in silence, EunHa looked into his black eyes and asked him again in a hoarse voice.



“Did you know who I was from the start?”

“Yes. Although, it was a surprise to find out that you worked for Serim.”
A silence settled in the room after KyungHyun’s reply. A frown gradually spread on EunHa’s blank face.
“…How did you know?”

“I heard you speaking to Kang SungHo in your apartment.”

There was no way that was true. She had only spoken to SungHo in her apartment a few times, and she’d only done it right around the time she started working at KeumOh.
“If there was a listening device, there’s no way I wouldn’t have seen it.”
“You’re right. The day I stayed over at your place, I got rid of them while you were asleep.”
EunHa’s white teeth fiercely bit down on her lips. She felt a hot flame blaze from within.
“You knew… You knew that I was from Serim and you kept me by your side?”
“Yeah.”
“Why…?”

EunHa’s eyes narrowed. A prick of red bled through her newly- wound bandages before spreading throughout the fabric.
“Please don’t get worked up. You need to remain calm.”

The doctor in the suit softly whispered, but EunHa didn’t pay any attention. She shook her head and glared at him with all the rage in



her heart.

“Why did you do that? You don’t seem like a man who has the time to fool around with a spy from a rival organization.”
EunHa raised her voice as KyungHyun remained silent.

“Did you bring me to the party so that you could execute me in front of all those people?!”
The unfamiliar woman who had kept silent throughout all this stepped forward.
“Lee EunHa-ssi, please calm down.”

“And who are you? Are you this man’s lover? I don’t care if you are, but could you mind your own business for now?”
“We are police, Lee EunHa-ssi.”

The woman cut her off as her face hardened.

“What?”

EunHa looked up at her in disbelief as she frowned. No matter how one looked at her, the woman didn’t look like police. No, if this woman was police, it didn’t make any sense that she could stand to be in the same room as Shin KyungHyun. The type of people that couldn’t stand to breathe the same air as gangsters were the police.
“What bullshit is that?” “You heard it correctly.”
KyungHyun replied indifferently. Seeing that EunHa was completely dumbfounded, the unfamiliar woman explained.
“I don’t know if you’ve ever heard of special forces within the police, but we specialize in infiltration.”



EunHa silently looked the woman up and down. Then her eyes went past the waiting doctor holding the syringe and went to General Manager Cha before finally landing on KyungHyun. She murmured in a hoarse voice.
“What are you all trying to do? If you plan on killing me, just do it. My identity has already been revealed, so what’s the point of putting on this show?”
“You’re right. Everyone in YongSung now knows your identity, so why do you think I would put on this show?”
KyungHyun’s black gaze captured her. EunHa frowned and bit her lip. She felt as if everything in her head was tangled up. She had a bad feeling about all of this.
“Are you telling me that you’re police?”

“Gangsters are people that value affiliations more than anyone.” “Is that so?” “Ah, and another group values it as well.” “Who?” “Cops.”
She briefly recalled their lighthearted conversation at the traditional Korean restaurant. KyungHyun gave her a blunt affirmation.
“Yes.”
“Not the mob… but the police.”

EunHa looked up at KyungHyun in confusion. This man, who she had thought was born to be a gangster, was actually police. For some reason, she felt more betrayed than shocked. She thought she was deceiving this man. However, it turned out that she was perfectly deceived instead.
“Haha…”



When KyungHyun saw her laughing at herself, he spoke up.

“For over 10 years, I’ve committed plenty of illegal acts, so it wouldn’t be completely wrong to say that I’m a gangster.”
The unfamiliar woman at his side coughed awkwardly with an uncomfortable expression on her face. EunHa glared at them and spoke in a cold voice.
“Explain it to me so that I can understand. Right now.”

The woman stepped forward and cautiously began to tell their story.
“As you may know, Lee EunHa-ssi, Serim and YongSung are the longest-operating criminal organizations in Korea.”
“And I’m sure the responsibility to enforce the law on them lies with the police.”
The woman didn’t seem bothered by EunHa’s mocking reply.

“Up until now, there were many instances and opportunities, but because of their illegal financial dealings with politicians, they were able to escape police capture. Because of this, prosecutors and police alike were frustrated. Extremely frustrated.”
“Even in our organization, everyone’s interests aren’t the same.”
At KyungHyun’s meaningful words, the woman briefly stopped speaking before continuing.
“12 years ago, right around the time when the election was drawing near, we received orders from the higher-ups to apprehend these mobs en masse. We were also told to insert one of our own to gain information from the inside. And back



then, the team leader, Superintendent Shin, was selected to be the double agent. And that’s how it all started.”
“…12 years?”

EunHa furrowed her brows.

“That’s right. It’s been a long time.”

KyungHyun nodded his head. EunHa looked at him and shook her head. That meant that KyungHyun had hidden within the mob for 12 years as he pretended to be one of them.
“Do you think that makes any sense?”

“I never thought it would last this long when I first started. When 5 years had passed, we had an opportunity to completely capture the leader. However, in the middle of all this, the political arena had completely shifted and everything we had worked for blew away with the wind.”
“…It had to do with the higher-ups, so there was nothing we could do.”
The woman lowered her head to KyungHyun with a stiff expression. Without responding to her, KyungHyun narrowed his eyes as he gazed at EunHa and continued to speak.
“When I first received my assignment, I was sent to Serim, not YongSung. After 4 years had passed, Kang SungHo sent me to YongSung.”
“…What did you say?”

EunHa’s voice trembled. Her temples throbbed, and she began to get a headache.
“It was an opportunity I couldn’t refuse. This was a chance



for us to know everything about both organizations. Even our higher-ups welcomed it with open arms.”
“Bullshit.”

Raon softly mumbled. YongSung’s Shin KyungHyun was a man working for Serim? She had been in Serim for 10 years, and she’d never heard of this.
“Around that time, I was a rookie who had just entered the organization. All the members in the organization that knew me were sent to the countryside because Kang SungHo didn’t want any information to be leaked out.”
“But Kang SungHo wanted me to…”

EunHa didn’t finish her sentence. KyungHyun looked at her and calmly asked.
“Did Kang SungHo order you to kill me?”

EunHa looked at him in shock. KyungHyun didn’t look disturbed at all. He merely looked at her with distant eyes as he continued to speak to her. Her uneasiness continued to grow.
“As I continued to move up in YongSung, Kang SungHo began to grow suspicious of me. What I’m telling you is that you’re not the first person he sent to spy on me.”
“There were seven people, Lee EunHa-ssi. After they returned to Serim, they all went missing.”
“Nine in total. Two of them died by my hands.”

KyungHyun corrected the woman. EunHa’s mouth was dry, but she still swallowed. There was still one thing she couldn’t understand.
“Then why did you continue to keep me by your side even



though you knew I was sent from Serim with orders to kill you?”
“……”

KyungHyun didn’t answer her question. Instead, the woman spoke.

“Lee EunHa-ssi, YongSung’s project of developing a new drug is actually a front to smuggle drugs into the country.”
“…So?”

Before she had shot Noh HyungChul, she had already overheard this piece of information.
“We believed that if Lee EunHa-ssi told Serim about these plans, Serim would definitely intervene. With that amount of Philopon being smuggled in, it would be enough for us to capture both YongSung and Serim in one go.”
“Then couldn’t Shin KyungHyun have told Kang SungHo directly himself?”
“…If Kang SungHo trusted me, he wouldn’t have sent you from the start.”
“Haha.”

EunHa laughed bitterly. She felt that she finally understood what they were saying now.
“So what you’re saying is… you were just using me.”

The reason why he kept her by his side even though he knew she was from Serim was because he wanted her to cloud SungHo’s judgement. Realizing that she was being used this whole time felt more wretched than expected. Why was she so disappointed? She was planning on using him as well anyway. Her cloudy eyes became



fierce.

“You must be frustrated that I’ve ruined everything. If everything went according to plan, I was supposed to relay this information to Serim. Am I right?”
KyungHyun, who had been silent, spoke up then. “Why did you try to kill Noh HyungChul?” “Is he not dead yet?”
“He’s been hospitalized and is currently hooked to a respirator.”
EunHa bit her lips until she felt them sting. If she hadn’t been shot in the last moment, she would have been able to successfully hit his heart. If she had only been a second faster, she would have been able to kill him. Even if she died in the process, she would have dragged him to hell with her. She would have laughed at his miserable face.
“There’s no way Kang SungHo ordered you to kill Noh HyungChul. He knows more than anyone that it would cause a war between the two organizations. So why did you do it?”
KyungHyun asked again in confusion. EunHa answered him with a gaunt, cold face.
“I… have no interest whatsoever in any of this that you’re all doing. Serim, YongSung… It’s all none of my business.”
KyungHyun let out a heavy sigh as his eyes gleamed. As he had been heading over to the founding party with EunHa, he went through all the possibilities. He had originally planned to take her to China with him to leak some of the information about their smuggling plans. However, he decided it would be better to let her listen in on his conversation instead of telling her directly, so he let her follow



him.

He had also set the 8th floor corridor security camera at an angle so that she wouldn’t be seen so easily. The GPS he had installed in her diamond necklace showed that she was coming closer and closer.
“Are you wondering why I shot that old grump?”

“You could have been shot and killed. Do you know that?!” As he bellowed this, the woman at his side quietly blocked him. “Lee EunHa-ssi is a patient.”
“Shut it.”

KyungHyun didn’t even look at his junior and spit out the order between gritted teeth. His previously blank face was now filled with rage. Even though he recognized that he was overwhelmed with fury, he couldn’t calm down. He had also considered the possibility of Lee EunHa getting caught. If she had been caught by Noh HyungChul’s bodyguard, he was going to step up and claim her as his woman to protect her.
Being the shrewd actress that she was, he trusted that she would play along. If Noh HyungChul acknowledged her as his woman, having her come with him to China would seem more natural. However, KyungHyun never expected her to behave so recklessly in a place filled with YongSung’s men.
“I’m asking you why you did something so suicidal and idiotic!”
“Because that bastard killed my parents.”

EunHa’s thin voice suddenly caused a heavy silence to fall inside the room. Everyone’s faces hardened as they stared at her.



“My father was a member of Serim who was killed by that bastard.”
Not only her father, but her mother too. Her young self ran away when she saw the corpses of her parents. But not now. Her eyes became sharp as she smirked.
“I wanted to twist a knife in his stomach, but I wasn’t able to. What a shame.”
The woman next to her hesitated before speaking.
“Lee EunHa-ssi…”

KyungHyun raised his hand and stopped her. The woman shut her mouth.
“Did you come to YongSung as a spy because of Noh HyungChul?”
“Yes.”

EunHa sharply raised her eyes. Her eyes glistened as they filled with tears.
“Not because Kang SungHo sent you?”

“I did everything he asked. I waited for the day he would send me to YongSung. I imagined ripping that old man apart hundreds of times for killing my mom and dad.”
KyungHyun’s black gaze on her deepened.

“But when I saw Noh HyungChul with my own eyes, I almost lost it. Serim or YongSung… Whether the organization kills me or whether everyone dies… It doesn’t matter, you see.”
Her tears clung onto her long eyelashes.



“But… What should I do… I wasn’t able to kill him in one shot… And I messed up like a fucking idiot…”
Her hot tears finally flowed down her dry cheeks. Watching her mock herself, KyungHyun spoke bitterly.
“I think… I understand now.”

“Mr. Policeman, can you tell me where that son of a bitch is?”
“Lee EunHa.”
“…Just tell me where he is. I’ll do whatever you want.
Please?”

KyungHyun, who had been quietly watching EunHa become hysterical, finally let out a heavy sigh.
“The man who killed your parents wasn’t Noh HyungChul. It was Kang SungHo.”
EunHa looked at him, her mouth open in shock. Her pupils wet with tears suddenly dilated. Her pale, blank face looked like that of a corpse.
“What?”

KyungHyun finally solved the puzzle. He finally understood why she had stayed in the hands of Kang SungHo, the man who killed her parents.
“Just now… What… What did you… just say… What kind of bullshit are you…”
EunHa’s pale lips trembled as she hastily glued her eyes to him.

“It’s just as you heard. Serim’s previous leader, President Jang, had great trust in your father, Lee EunHa-ssi. If



everything went according to plan, the next leader would have been your father. Kang SungHo couldn’t accept that, so he murdered your parents himself and set your house on fire…”
“Don’t be ridiculous!”

EunHa shouted. The unfamiliar woman shut her mouth briefly before she calmly continued.
“After killing your parents and setting your house on fire, he presented false evidence and framed it on YongSung. That was the beginning of the conﬂict between the two organizations. In the process, many men were sacrificed. After Kang SungHo killed his own boss, he was finally able to obtain the position he has now.”
“Lie… Don’t lie…”

When EunHa mumbled hysterically, KyungHyun replied in a soft voice.
“It’s the truth.”
“Do you have proof? Proof… I’m asking you if you have proof!”
EunHa looked at him in disbelief. KyungHyun’s voice became lower.
“That night, the one who turned you over to the police was me. I was the one you ran into on the street.”
EunHa frowned. Suddenly, like a crazy woman, she began to laugh in a shrill voice.
“Haha, hahaha! Shove your bullshit up your ass. Aah. You’re all so funny. What are you saying? Everything was a



lie from the very beginning!”

KyungHyun took out a picture from the inside pocket of his jacket. As she fixed her dizzy eyes to it, her shoulders began to sporadically shake.
“These are the belongings that fell out of sixteen-year-old Lee EunHa’s pocket. A cellphone with a dead battery and a dog treat. Your last call was to Arizona, USA.”
“Save me… Mister… Please, please save me… Huuu…”

There was no way. The sharp face that gazed at her from underneath the black cap perfectly overlapped with KyungHyun’s. EunHa frantically shook her head.
“No!”

This couldn’t be. She was definitely mistaken. EunHa tried with all her might to forget that night. Her cluttered mind was filled with fog, making everything hazy. If this was true, then she wouldn’t be able to sleep anymore. Her eyes shook as she lost focus.
“Do you really not remember? Kang SungHo was one of the men that entered your house!”
KyungHyun spoke through his teeth in frustration. He held her back as she tried to escape. Suddenly, all the terrible memories from that night that she had tried so hard to forget began to flood her mind. Squeak. Squeak. The sound of shoes walking across the hardwood floors were so clear. EunHa’s chin began to tremble so hard that her teeth chattered.
“Where is our princess hiding…”

Tap. Glazed in fear, a teardrop fell from her eyes without warning. In the room where her dead father laid, EunHa was hiding behind the wooden door as the terrifying voice tore through her mind. Within the



memories that she had tried so hard to forget, a thin voice whispered in her ear.
“Princess, from now on, all you have to do is follow Ahjussi’s orders.”
This was SungHo’s voice. The one she had heard countless times.
EunHa shook her head and let out a piercing shriek.

“Aaaaagh!”

EunHa fiercely pulled at the IV in her arm. She grabbed the bottle and shattered it before taking a broken shard.
“Lee EunHa-ssi!” “Lee EunHa!”
All the eyes on her widened in shock. EunHa didn’t hesitate as she pierced her jugular with the shard. She wanted to die.
TN: A depressing cliffhanger to end on, but… Surprise release!
 I couldn’t keep this one to myself! So many long-awaited revelations!!! I wanted to share this update with all of you ASAP!!!
□□□






EunHa exited her school in her gym uniform. Her skirt had been slashed to shreds by a box cutter and was now inside her backpack. Within a week since she had transferred into this school, she had become an outcast. This was because she had consistently ignored any kid that came up to speak to her. When a clique of them began to provoke her by asking her if she thought she was too good for them, EunHa went to her homeroom teacher and reported them, and so they retaliated several-fold.
Three days had passed since all her textbooks had gone missing. Today, she discovered her uniform skirt slashed to shreds in her locker. Even though she desperately wanted to return to the United States, the distant relatives that took her in were not financially stable.
Should I just quit school?

She wanted to quit school and earn money to leave this place. She no longer wanted to stay in the place where her parents had died, and it was becoming difficult to continue to receive her relatives’ dissatisfied looks. Just as long as she could purchase a plane ticket, she’d make it work. As she was thinking this, someone called out to her.
“So you’re EunHa.”

EunHa raised her head and looked at the person who spoke. She stared at the person who had a scar on his brow and stopped in her tracks.
“……” “Do you know who I am?”



She had never met this man before. Wearing a black coat and leather gloves, the man grinned at her. Observing his sharp face, EunHa had a feeling that she shouldn’t get close to this man. She answered softly.
“…No, I don’t.” “I’m your father’s friend. Don’t you remember me?” “…I didn’t see you at the funeral either. How can I trust that you’re actually my father’s friend?”
EunHa shook her head. As he gazed at her, a strange smile stretched across his lips.
“You really don’t recognize me.” “If you come near me, I’ll call the police.”
As her hair fell and covered her face, EunHa murmured softly. 6 months had passed since she had witnessed her parents’ horrifying deaths, but she still had a difficult time speaking with people. She had developed sociophobia.
“Here. Will you believe me with this?”

The man held out his cellphone to her. EunHa’s eyes lowered to the screen. She saw a picture of her father and this man.
“Go ahead and swipe through the rest.”

EunHa remained where she was and didn’t move, so the man touched the screen himself. She saw many photos flash by.
“I thought I wouldn’t have any photos of us together, but there were more than I expected.”
What he said was true. She saw many pictures of her father with this man in many locations. Some pictures showed them with other people, and there was even a photo of them together at a fishing hole.



The last picture was a group photo. At the center of a group of men in suits, her father was in a tuxedo as he stood next to her mother in a wedding dress.
Tears began to well up in EunHa’s black eyes. She thought that she didn’t have any more tears left to shed, but her heart still twisted whenever she saw a picture of her parents.
“You were still in your mother’s belly here.”

The man’s eyes became cloudy as he recalled the past with a smile.
“We were so shocked when he suddenly told us he was getting married. We were still so young back then, and we didn’t have anything to our names. When you father told us your mother was pregnant, we were all so surprised and happy for him. I remember we got insanely drunk that night.” “…I think I’ve seen enough.”
EunHa quietly murmured, and the man put his cellphone back into his pocket.
“Then are you willing to talk to Ahjussi for a little bit?” “About what?”
Even though she was still eyeing him cautiously, she no longer avoided his eyes.
“About your parents’ deaths.”

The playground was empty. Only the sound of the wind whistling through the leaves could be heard.
Sitting on a paint-chipped bench, the man was smoking a cigarette. EunHa sat by his side in silence when the man didn’t begin speaking. Suddenly, she broke the silence.



“If it’s about that night, I’ve already told the detectives everything I know. I don’t know anything. I didn’t see the men’s faces.”
The man took a deep drag of the cigarette before letting out a long sigh, blowing out the smoke.
“The most incompetent organization in Korea is the police.” “……”
Unable to agree or disagree, EunHa just stared at him quietly. The man finally finished his cigarette and threw the cigarette butt on the ground before fiercely grinding it with his shoe.
“I didn’t come here to ask you about that day.” “…Then why did you?” “The man who was your father… He was like family to me. For 15 years, we served the same boss and went through all sorts of hardships together.” “…So you’re also in the mob?”
EunHa raised her head and asked him. Even though her voice sounded indifferent, her black eyes widened as they slightly trembled.
“So you knew what kind of work your father did.” “I heard the detectives talking about it.”
EunHa pleaded to the detectives to catch the people who did this, but they brushed off the murders to be a result of a conflict between two gangs. Even though her father was a man of few words, he was an incredibly tender man when it came to his family, and he was the smartest man in the world. To think that the office he had been pouring his heart and soul into was actually a criminal organization. That was the first time EunHa had heard about this.
“So do you hate and fear the fact that I’m also in the mob?”



EunHa silently shook her head.

“You can be honest.”

A black van rolled up to the front of the playground. When the driver lowered the window and stared at him, the man raised his hand and gestured for him to wait for a while longer.
“Well, my father was also a member of the mob. And you’re also a friend of his.”
The man looked at her and grinned. The scar on his brow deepened.
“How fortunate.” “…What is?” “Nothing. I’m just glad that this neighborhood is so quiet. It’s perfect for conversations like this.”
The wind blew against the old swings, making them creak. A dry, dull leaf fluttered down and flew away with the wind. EunHa wet her dry lips and called out to the man.
“Ahjussi.” “Hm?” “Do you know who killed my mom and dad?” “…And what if I do?” “Can you tell me who it is?”
SungHo bit his lip. When he didn’t answer, EunHa raised her voice a bit more.
“Ahjussi, you said you were my dad’s friend. Please tell me.”
EunHa’s eyes filled with tears once more. With his hands in his coat pockets, he merely stared at her with steady eyes.
“The detectives won’t tell me anything. They told me that it’s best if I don’t know these things because I’m too young. It doesn’t make any sense. My mom and dad died… They died right in front of my eyes…”



A tear dripped down EunHa’s cheek.

“What killed your parents was ‘YongSung’.”

YongSung.

EunHa blinked when he finally answered her.
“Yong…Sung?” “Yeah. YongSung’s leader, Noh HyungChul, ordered for the death of your father, our leader’s right-hand man, in order to start a conﬂict between our two organizations.”
YongSung’s leader. Noh HyungChul.

EunHa bit down on her lips until they bled. She carved that name into her brain. Her eyes were red from crying.
“Our organization will avenge your father no matter what.
So there’s no need to worry.” “…I want to help too.”

SungHo looked at her with a blank expression. The sunken scar on his brow deepened.
“What did you just say?”

EunHa grabbed on to the hem of his coat. Her white, thin hand was shaking. Her long hair was stuck to her wet cheeks. Looking a mess, she pleaded once again.
“I want to do whatever I can to help. Please, even if it’s just cleaning. So can’t I just go with you, Ahjussi?”
The man burst out laughing as he lit another cigarette.

“Please, Ahjussi.”

An indescribable gleam entered the man’s eyes as he looked at her.



“…You are very much like your father.”
Another hot tear traveled down EunHa’s cheek. She rubbed it away with her hand.
“Your father was incredibly smart and talented. He was a bit stubborn, but… it’s such a shame that he went like that. If he were alive, he would definitely have made it to the top of Serim.”
SungHo bit the cigarette and got up from his seat. He began taking off his leather glove.
“Once you hold this hand, you will become a part of my family.”
He blocked EunHa as she held up her own hand without hesitation. Whoosh, the cold wind rustled her hair making them stick to her wet cheeks.
“Before you hold it, think carefully. Becoming a member of my family means that you must follow my orders no matter what.” “…All right.” “If you betray me, I’ll kill you. Just because you’re my hyung-nim’s daughter doesn’t mean you’re an exception. If you’re scared, run away now.”
EunHa shot up from her seat and snatched his hand. SungHo laughed in his thin voice. His damp, cold hands tightened on hers. It felt as if she were holding a slippery snake in her hands.
That day, only her backpack holding her shredded skirt was left behind on the bench, and EunHa had disappeared. Before she had gone missing, an eyewitness claimed to have seen her getting into a black van of her own accord. But other than that, no one could find any trace of her.
KyungHyun rushed to her bedside and grabbed her wrist. A sob tore out of EunHa’s mouth.



“Let go… Let go!”
After SungHo had taken her away, a bloody war had begun between Serim and YongSung, just like he told her. Ultimately, both organizations had lost hundreds of men, and the conflict had come to an end.
The leader who SungHo had served died, and SungHo took his place. He then sent her to the United States and ordered her to study there. It seemed that he had bigger plans for her than having her clean. However, she didn’t hear any news of the death of Noh HyungChul, YongSung’s leader.
“Get ahold of yourself, Lee EunHa!”
“What do you know… Let go, let go of me!”

SungHo had told her that it was too dangerous to attack Noh HyungChul now, and when EunHa had screamed and cried at him, he put her in an underground warehouse for three days where she saw no light. She thought she would starve to death, and in the haze of fear, EunHa realized what position she was in.
If she didn’t follow SungHo’s orders, he could kill her. She wouldn’t be able to escape, and even if she did, he’d catch her and kill her. Once she realized this truth, EunHa’s attitude changed.
“I want to die… I’m going to die!”

She did everything he ordered her to do. She picked up many languages and learned to seduce men. She didn’t decline the missions where she was told to extract information in bed. If he told her to crawl on all fours naked, she crawled. If he told her to lick the floor, she licked. In order to gain his trust, she did everything so that she could avenge the death of her parents.
However, for 10 years, she never knew that the man right in front of her eyes was the man who killed them.



Her whole body trembled with shame. It would be better if she just died. Her hand began to bleed as she tightened it around the glass shard in anger. The blood ran down and dripped onto KyungHyun’s hand on her wrist.
“Now that you know who actually killed your parents, shouldn’t you fix your gaze onto him? Knowing you, that’s exactly what you should do!”
KyungHyun bitterly hissed through his teeth as his eyes turned pitch black. Captured by his gaze, EunHa screamed.
“You don’t know anything, so don’t give me that bullshit!”

In the meantime, KyungHyun’s grasp was gradually tightening. It felt like he was really going to snap her wrist.
“Ugh…!”

In the end, EunHa dropped the bloodstained glass shard onto the bed. KyungHyun didn’t let go of her wrist. Because the blood wasn’t circulating through his grasp, her hand began to turn white. Tears continued to drip down her face. As he watched her bite her lips, KyungHyun lowered his head to hers and whispered.
“I’ll help you kill Kang SungHo.” “Superintendent Shin… That’s…” “Don’t butt in.”
The woman stepped back and shut her mouth.

“That bastard fooled you for 10 years. Isn’t it a waste to just die now?”
Her tears continued to roll down her cheeks. She felt as if her head was going to explode. She didn’t think she could stop the urge to bite



her tongue and die right here, right now. EunHa shut her eyes and spoke through her gritted teeth.
“Knock me out.” “…What?”
“Make me sleep. Let me go to sleep!” “Sedative.”
She felt a stinging pain on her arm. As she panted for breath, EunHa began to count backwards from ten. When she got down to five, everything was still clear. She felt as if her body would burst into flames from her anger at Kang SungHo.
“Give her another one.” “But sir…”
“Do as I say!”

Still trembling, EunHa counted down to three. Her mind turned black, and everything turned dark. As she lost consciousness, she wished she would never wake up.
TN: Sorry for the late update! I thought I scheduled this to post on time, but I guess I didn’t! That’s my bad. Poor EH… I can’t even imagine the pain she’s feeling after realizing all the nasty things she did for SH was all just a waste… and that she was actually serving the man who killed her parents. I’m sure she’s feeling absolutely hopeless right now. 






“What are you going to do now, Sunbae-nim?”

KyungHyun gazed at EunHa. She had finally fallen asleep after receiving the sedatives. He raised his head. He had lost weight in the past few days.
“…I need to give Kang SungHo a call.”

He took out his cellphone and left the room. His colleagues followed behind him.
“What are you going to say to him?”

Lieutenant Cha JoongWon, who had been standing outside the room, looked at him with worried eyes. He was KyungHyun’s police subordinate and the man he had become accustomed to calling General Manager Cha.
“Now that the patient has woken up, I should report it.”

KyungHyun pressed the speakerphone button and placed the cellphone on the table. He then leaned on the sofa and took out a cigarette. As expected, SungHo answered the call as soon as it started to ring. He had definitely been waiting for KyungHyun’s call.
⦁	What a pleasant surprise. Director Shin has decided to call me for a change.
“Things have been happening on our side lately.”

Biting his cigarette, KyungHyun crossed his legs.
⦁	Really? What happened?


“Three days ago, one of my newly recruited employees came to the YongSung founding party and shot Noh HyungChul.”
⦁	And why are you telling me such an important thing now?
SungHo’s voice over the speakerphone sounded sharp, but it didn’t sound surprised. No matter how hard KyungHyun tried to keep the word from spreading, there was no way SungHo hadn’t heard about such grave news within YongSung.
“I needed to check something first.”
⦁	Check what?
“I needed to know who was behind this. It might have been the work of another mob organization, but I couldn’t rule out the possibility of another coup from the inside.”
⦁	…Then wouldn’t torturing the bitch who shot the gun do the trick?
“I never said it was a woman. You’re very intuitive.”

There was a moment of silence. Everyone listening to the speakerphone on the table had grave expressions on their faces. KyungHyun didn’t wait for SungHo’s answer and languidly spoke.
“Anyways, even if I wanted to torture her, she got shot in the process and fainted, so that wasn’t an option.”
⦁	…Did she die?
SungHo’s soft voice sounded serious as he asked.

“No. She woke up just a while ago.”

KyungHyun took a deep drag of the cigarette as he observed the tension. Even though there was no sound coming from the



speakerphone, SungHo had not ended the call.

“As you said, we did some work on her. And she told us that she worked for Serim.”
⦁	What a wicked bitch. I don’t know anything about this.
As SungHo feigned ignorance, KyungHyun slowly exhaled the cigarette smoke. His dark eyebrows went up. He had already expected SungHo to react like this.
“Then it shouldn’t matter if I kill the woman. I understand. There are still things I want to figure out, so I’ll spend a bit more time with her before I take care of her.”
General Manager Cha and Lieutenant Han caught their breaths. They didn’t know why KyungHyun was speaking like this to SungHo.
⦁	Director Shin.
“Yes, sir?”

They heard the clicking of a lighter through the speakerphone.
SungHo cleared his throat and exhaled the cigarette smoke.
⦁	That bitch. Send her to me.
KyungHyun had a blank expression on his face as he coldly replied.

“You just told me that she has no connection to you, Hyung-nim. Didn’t you?”
⦁	KyungHyun.
The intervals between the clicking of the lighter gradually became shorter.
⦁	It’s true that I sent her to help you out as a colleague because you had a lot on your plate. I was planning on telling you a bit later.


“Is that so?”

KyungHyun’s indifferent tone seemed to suggest that he didn’t believe SungHo.
⦁	You don’t think that I ordered that bitch to shoot Noh HyungChul, do you? If I wanted that, why wouldn’t I just send you?
When KyungHyun didn’t respond, SungHo raised his voice.
⦁	Send that bitch back. If she has to die, I’ll be the one to kill her. The crime of putting our dear Director Shin in an awkward position is a serious one.
“I’ll think about it, Hyung-nim.
⦁	What?
SungHo’s thin voice cracked unpleasantly. KyungHyun took another drag of the cigarette, which had now been burned to the filter. He let out a long sigh as he exhaled the smoke before pressing the cigarette butt onto the ashtray.
“Did I stutter?”
⦁	So now you’re arguing with me?
KyungHyun could hear SungHo grind his teeth with rage.

“In a situation like this where you’ve put a tail on me because you can’t trust me… Don’t you think I have some questions as well? I’ll take full advantage of having a woman from Serim in the palm of my hands.”
⦁	Just now… you dare to… Are you telling me that you’re going to go against me?
“You can think whatever you’d like.”



A cruel gleam flashed across KyungHyun’s eyes as he calmly replied.
“I’ll talk to you another time, sir. Goodbye.”

Without waiting for SungHo’s reponse, KyungHyun ended the call.
He could clearly imagine SungHo’s furious reaction right now.

“What do you plan on doing now? If you turn your back on Kang SungHo now, things will get difficult.”
After making sure the call had definitely ended, General Manager Cha cautiously spoke to KyungHyun.
“We’ve both reached an understanding a long time ago. We just didn’t say it out loud. Let’s plan our operation on Serim once this matter is over.”
“Sunbae-nim, why don’t we just win over Lee EunHa and send her back to Serim?”
KyungHyun shook his head at Lieutenant Han’s cautious suggestion.
“If Lee EunHa sees Kang SungHo right before her eyes, she’ll try to kill him.”
Judging from her attempted suicide just now, KyungHyun wasn’t wrong. However, if they could convince EunHa to work with them, they might be able to turn this messed up situation around.
“But…”

Lieutenant Han was about to try and convince him otherwise, but KyungHyun cut her off.
“Well, it might actually be better off that way. Rather than following after the gangs for 10 years and cleaning up after



their shit in the name of justice, it might just be better to kill off the leader of the organization. Don’t you think?”
“Superintendent Shin.”

General Manager Cha spoke up softly when he saw that Lieutenant Han was too dumbfounded to say anything.
“I know. We’re police. Not thugs.” “……”
“I will act according to protocol, so don’t worry.” “…I apologize if you thought we were worried.” “No need to apologize.”
Click. KyungHyun lit another cigarette and bit down on it as he chuckled. His exhaustion could be clearly seen on his weathered face. His colleagues understood very well how he felt.
Korean history has shown that there was a long-standing union between the mob and national politics. Every time their superiors changed with the political climate, the end goal of their mission would slowly get pushed back. Whenever this happened, they would have to replan everything, and the one who was in the most danger at these times was the man in the front lines, KyungHyun.
At the beginning, he wasn’t the only one who had been planted. KyungHyun, who had graduated the academy at the top of his class, had been picked alongside five veterans of the violent crimes division.
However, everyone but KyungHyun had been exposed or killed. There was no way KyungHyun was the only lucky one to escape unscathed.



Nevertheless, KyungHyun was able to frequent both YongSung and Serim for 12 years. And he managed to get these results by sheer willpower. He made decisions that decreased the possibility of making mistakes and didn’t show any weakness. Anyone watching over KyungHyun couldn’t deny his incredible talent.
3 years had passed since Cha JoongWon had been planted in YongSung. He was often thankful for starting his life as a cop instead of a gangster.
“What should we do about the public sentiment within YongSung?”
“Let the word out that Lee EunHa will die by my hands and that she’s a spy sent from Serim.”
“And what will happen if the people at YongSung go after Serim? It’ll become a huge fiasco.”
Lieutenant Han recalled the massacre that took place 10 years ago and spoke up with a grave expression.
“Until Noh HyungChul recovers, no one will make a move just yet.”
This meant that the gangsters of YongSung wouldn’t be making any rash decisions while their leader was lying in his sickbed. General Manager Cha nodded his head.
“Understood, sir. Also, Im SungJoon came up from Busan last night. Please be careful.”
Im SungJoon, the man in charge of the operations in Busan and Kyungnam, was another man who had Noh HyungChul’s trust and confidence. He usually didn’t leave his territory, but it seemed that he hurried up here when he heard of the attack on his boss.
“We’ll figure out what to do about the Shenzhen matter



now. If Im SungJoon notices anything, it’ll be troublesome.”

Im SungJoon didn’t like how KyungHyun had gained so much influence and power within YongSung so quickly. On top of that, he was a very observant man, so it would be best for them to lay low for now.
“Yes, sir. I’ll prepare everything accordingly.” “Also, Lieutenant Han.”
“Yes, sir.”

“Get in contact with Kim MinSuk’s advisor and leak out the fact that Noh HyungChul is currently hospitalized after having been attacked.”
“What good will come of Mayor Kim knowing about this? The possibility of him backstabbing Noh HyungChul is high.”
Lieutenant Han anxiously spoke up, but KyungHyun looked at her with a cold gleam in his eye.
“That’s exactly what I want.”

Noh HyungChul was a man who knew very well how much corruption Kim MinSuk had taken part in all this time. Noh HyungChul had made illegal donations to Kim MinSuk in order to keep his self- interests intact. In other words, they shared a symbiotic relationship. However, if Kim MinSuk planned to run for the presidency, his most dangerous liability was Noh HyungChul.
Kim MinSuk hadn’t been happy with YongSung’s most recent demands, but he complied because he was afraid their connection would be revealed to the public.
Up until now, KyungHyun had done his best to gather the evidence of Kim MinSuk’s illegal activities and corruption, but Noh HyungChul



never showed the specifics of these activities to anyone.

“If Kim MinSuk decides to take the bait, this might be our only chance to tie him to Noh HyungChul and take them both down. Since Noh HyungChul is currently bedridden and can’t leave his hospital bed, we need to find another way to prosecute him. If an irrefutable piece of evidence comes to light, even the prosecutors who are turning a blind eye to all this won’t be able to sit still.”
Having Noh HyungChul leave the country was a crucial step in this project, which they had been developing with the cooperation of the Chinese police. Before he became the leader of YongSung, Noh HyungChul did time for 10 years for embezzlement and conspiracy to murder in his early thirties. Nowadays, he was very reluctant to personally go out and do the dirty work.
After he was released from prison, he expanded his business to illegal stock manipulations and investments. However, only his subordinates were charged for petty offenses.
Because of this, for half a year, all the team members began to plan a massive bust of the illegal dealings of Philopon in the black market. They did all this to draw out the elusive leader of YongSung into a place where they could arrest him. Now that this was all water under the bridge, they needed to modify the plan. And it was up to KyungHyun to do this.
“Do you have a plan in mind?”

“Even if I don’t, I need to make one.”

KyungHyun bit his cigarette as he murmured. Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha gave each other a look. Their boss’s unwavering attitude in the midst of this crisis gave them a bit of comfort.



“Understood, sir.” “Then you may leave.”
They were currently in the penthouse of the hotel owned by KeumOh. KyungHyun had been living here for a few years now. It was the safest place to be in order to avoid any suspicions, but they still needed to be careful because the whole building was crawling with YongSung’s gangsters.
After giving a short greeting, General Manager Cha left first. Dressed as a call girl, Lieutenant Han began to follow after him, but she stopped when she got to the door and turned around.
“Superintendent Shin.”

Smoke flowed out of the cigarette held between KyungHyun’s long fingers. The man seemed to perfectly suit this dreary, colorless room. He opened his mouth and let out a short reply.
“What?”
“…About your decision to keep Lee EunHa from returning to Serim… Is there another reason for that decision?”
KyungHyun tilted his head as he gazed at Lieutenant Han before answering indifferently.
“What do you mean?”

“I was just wondering if you had a personal reason for making that decision.”
“What personal reason?”

When Lieutenant Han hesitated, KyungHyun answered for her.

“Are you talking about romantic feelings?”



“I didn’t mean to pry into your personal life, but…” “If you want to report it to my superiors, go ahead.”
When KyungHyun scoffed, Lieutenant Han quickly raised her voice.

“That’s not what I meant. We’re all on the same team. I only wanted to tell you that there’s a high chance you’ll be in danger, Superintendent Shin.”
KyungHyun stared at her as he languidly murmured.

“I feel like an incompetent boss for making my subordinates worry.” 
“…I apologize if I crossed the line.”

KyungHyun silently gazed at Lieutenant Han as she lowered her head. He understood her worries very well. As a newcomer to this team, she was stressed about having to completely modify a plan they had been working on for half a year.
“Lieutenant Han.” “Yes, sir?”
“Lee EunHa told me this not too long ago. She said that when it came down to it, she’d rather choose the capable thugs over the incompetent police.”
Lieutenant Han’s brow slightly twitched. KyungHyun continued as he mocked himself.
“Don’t those words hurt your pride?” “…Yes, sir.”
“Even if it’s for my own ‘personal reasons’, I want to show Lee EunHa.”



“Show her what?”

“That the police haven’t been doing nothing. That we have been working on this for the past 10 years. That we’re still working on it.”
“We’ve never done nothing about this, sir.”

“You’re right. So I want to show her that we’re going to end those bastards on our terms.”
“Is it… because of the guilt you feel for having been unable to protect Lee EunHa-ssi’s family 10 years ago?”
Lieutenant Han had a strange ability to catch someone off guard with her observations. This skill shone the brightest when she was interrogating a suspect for their special crimes unit. Feeling as if he was being treated like a criminal, KyungHyun felt bitter inside.
However, KyungHyun also couldn’t help but chuckle at his lieutenant’s attitude as she carefully tried to warn her boss about his decisions.
“I can’t say that I don’t feel any guilt. However, that’s not the only reason.”
He felt that it would be for the best to answer truthfully instead of making up an excuse. If he didn’t give a justification for his behavior, there was a chance this competent subordinate of his would defy his commands.
“Do you know how Lee EunHa’s face looked as she pulled the trigger to shoot Noh HyungChul?”
“How did she look?”

“She looked exactly the same as when she escaped the murder at her house 10 years ago. She was trembling in fear,



but she still shot him. Even with a gun at her head. Even though she knew she’d surely die.”
Lieutenant Han blinked in silence. Her eyes looked unfocused as if she were looking at something far away. Then her expression turned dark.
“Lee EunHa proved to us herself that she is no longer the child who ran away from violence.”
“…Most humans grow up and adapt.”

“You’re right. Lee EunHa grew up very well. When I saw her, all the guilt that lay deep down in my heart ﬂew away in an instant, but…”
KyungHyun wet his dry lips.
“…When Lee EunHa was shot down in front of my eyes, I almost lost it. I felt as if I’ve failed her again.”
“…Failed her?”

Lieutenant Han thought that these words were very unlike KyungHyun. KyungHyun looked up and met her eyes.
“10 years ago, after that incident, when Kang SungHo found her and kidnapped her, I already failed her once.”
“Superintendent Shin.”

“When I heard that Lee EunHa had gone missing, I believed that Kang SungHo had ultimately killed her.”
“I do believe that he found Lee EunHa-ssi to get rid of her, but don’t know what made him change his mind in the last moment.”
“That’s exactly what’s bothering me so much.”



When Lieutenant Han looked at him in confusion, KyungHyun spoke again in a languid voice.
“If I stopped to think about it, I could have figured out that Kang SungHo would find Lee EunHa and kill her. I knew that he was a man who would dig out any possible threat by its roots. And yet, I remained an onlooker in all of this.”
After turning her over to the police, he should have put her under police protection. If he had done this, the following events would never have taken place. No, if he had only kept a better watch over Kang SungHo at Serim, would he have realized that Lee EunHa hadn’t died and was still alive? That she was actually operating as a member of Serim all this time?
“You didn’t do that deliberately. Every human makes mistakes. Police are human too.”
Lieutenant Han spoke clearly as she defended him. KyungHyun frowned as he chuckled.
“I don’t want to make another mistake when it comes to Lee EunHa. I’d rather be stabbed with a knife than be incompetent in her eyes once again.”
“…I understand, sir.”

Lieutenant Han quickly recognized what was going on from her short conversation with KyungHyun. He would never put Lee EunHa in any danger, and that decision would never change.
“It doesn’t matter if you report this to my superiors.” “I won’t report it, sir. I understand.”
“I didn’t say anything important, though. Weren’t you curious about whether I had any personal emotions when it came to that woman?”



When KyungHyun calmly asked her, Lieutenant Han shook her head.
“…You don’t have to tell me, sir. I don’t think I need to know any more than what you’ve told me.”
“Did I answer your question then?” “Yes. It was sufficient.”
Lieutenant Han nodded at him. When KyungHyun had told her that he didn’t want to let Lee EunHa down again, his brooding face gave her the answer she was looking for. What one saw was often more powerful than the words one heard.
He had always been a cold man, and no one could figure out what he was thinking. She had her suspicions when she asked him why he was showing such strange emotions and treating Lee EunHa like a victim. Even if he did feel something for her, she never expected KyungHyun to answer so openly.
‘He’s a pretty straightforward guy.’

Thinking that it wasn’t so bad to see a human side to this man, Lieutenant Han finally exited the room.
Click.

When KyungHyun heard the door close, he raised his hand and pressed his temple. Just behind his wall, there was a young woman lying there who made his nerves bristle. As he recalled the moment when this woman had been shot, all the blood rushed to one side of his head, giving him a migraine.
Bang!

The moment he saw the dark red blood burst out of EunHa’s body, his body moved faster than he could think. Even though he knew it



was dangerous, he shot the gangsters of YongSung, including Noh HyungChul’s bodyguard.
“……”

There were many times when KyungHyun had to make an independent decision while carrying out an operation. However, he had never made such a decision for the sake of someone else before. He had always made it for his own wellbeing. This was because if he ever died in the middle of the operation, all the hard work that the team had put into this mission would disappear in an instant. KyungHyun believed this would be the most harmful outcome.
‘It’s dangerous. As expected.’

KyungHyun thought to himself and smiled bitterly. Until a few months ago, he never would have thought that he’d have to modify his plans for the sake of one woman. It didn’t make any sense for him to disregard the danger and risk his own life.
‘Am I being punished?’

In the past, he never understood how his subordinates could tremble in fear because of their lovers, and he’d laugh at them. If his past self could see him now, he’d be absolutely dumbfounded. He had also felt annoyed whenever one of YongSung’s men would take a glance at her. He had even childishly thought that it would have been better if Lee EunHa was less beautiful.
He bent over to extinguish his cigarette, and he caught sight of his reflection on the glass table. With a big hand, he rubbed the anxious expression on his face.
‘Why are you holding back?’

Actually, since a while ago, he constantly wanted to see that woman’s face. As soon as Lieutenant Han left the room, his heart wanted him to rush over to the bedroom next door and burst through



the door. Even though he knew she was safe, he wanted to make sure with his own two eyes. If he could, he wanted to keep her in his sight until she fully recovered.
No, actually, he already decided to do just that. Ever since he infiltrated the organization, he always practiced restraint. But for the first time, he didn’t care if he broke this rule that no one else had enforced on him. He would have to be responsible for his own behavior, but wasn’t that always the case?
After he realized that there was no need to hold back his feelings, KyungHyun burst out of his seat and walked towards the bedroom without hesitation. He felt that he would only be satisfied when he saw the object of his desire.




EunHa slowly lifted her heavy eyelids. She had finished dinner and had been thinking absentmindedly when she fell asleep without realizing it.
The room she was in wasn’t that dark, even at night. to the bed, there was a large window without any curtains or blinds. She could clearly see the headlights of the cars driving across the bridge.
“Phew…”

EunHa wet her dry lips and let out a deep sigh. Ten days had passed since she was locked up inside this room against her will. If she included the days she had been unconscious from her gunshot wound, it was closer to 2 weeks.
The doctor in the suit who was disguised as an office worker had come to her room at the same time every day to check on her. 4 days ago, he declared that she was on the road to recovery and hadn’t returned since. Therefore, KyungHyun was the one who came instead to disinfect her wound. He also washed her in the bathroom once a day, taking care to keep her bandaged arm dry. She tried to refuse, but it was no use. Thanks to him, she realized that it was a lot more comfortable to use both hands when washing her hair.
He was also the one who took care of her meals. If she whined about not wanting to eat anymore, he pretended not to hear her and shoved the spoon into her mouth. Therefore, EunHa helplessly ate all her meals regularly and ate the same amount as he did. Thanks to him, she felt that she had gained some weight while she was locked up in this room.
Clink.



When EunHa unconsciously moved, the lump of metal at her wrist rattled against the iron pole of the headboard. Two days ago, while KyungHyun was out of the room to talk on the phone, she had attempted to escape. He caught her and handcuffed her to the bed.
Frowning, EunHa grabbed the bell on the table and angrily rang it. Soon, the door opened and KyungHyun came inside holding a glass of whiskey.
“What?”

EunHa silently glared at him as he stared back at her. He indifferently asked her a question when she didn’t say anything.
“Bathroom?”

Instead of responding, EunHa bit her lip in frustration. He sat down by her bed and began to unlock the handcuffs. Whenever she had the chance, EunHa tried to attack him, but KyungHyun always subdued her easily. It didn’t take long for her to realize that it was pointless. She silently watched him as he unlocked her handcuffs.
Cling. A metallic noise sprang from the handcuffs as they became undone. EunHa sprang up from her seat and walked towards the bathroom. Before KyungHyun could follow behind her, she closed the door. She proceeded to do her business as slow as possible.
Just when was he going to let her out of here?

The back of her shoulder still throbbed, but she could move her arm just fine. As if he had read her mind, he always kept her handcuffed to the bed whenever he had to leave or if she was ever alone in the room.
EunHa took her time as she washed her hands in frustration before turning around to leave the bathroom. As soon as she opened the door, she saw KyungHyun standing there, keeping watch. Behind him, the door leading to the living room was tightly shut as always.



They were currently in a room on the top floor of a hotel that KeumOh owned. She knew that this was where KyungHyun lived from when she had initially investigated him. Back then, she had planned to infiltrate this personal space of his by seducing him, but she never imagined she’d end up here like this.
Judging from the size of the bedroom, living room, and study alone, this room seemed to be the size of a penthouse. However, because there was only a handful of furniture inside, it looked desolate and dreary. The living room only had a treadmill and a weight training bench, a long sofa, a cabinet, and a safe. That was it.
The bedroom where EunHa stayed was even worse. There was only a single bed with an iron headboard, a square table that looked like junk, and a backless chair. It was as if the room itself didn’t realize it was at the top of a 35-story hotel. Instead of a bedroom, it was more like an interrogation room or a prison cell.
Still, she hoped to be able to sneak into the safe and find a weapon in there. However, she came to the conclusion that she’d never have the time to do this. But maybe she could grab his gun whenever it was in sight.
If nothing else worked, she planned on running into the kitchen. Even if it was merely a decoration at this point, wouldn’t she still be able to find a kitchen knife on a shelf somewhere?
If she could only fend off KyungHyun’s hand-to-hand combat for a little bit, she might be able to escape this hotel after all.
Her heart began to race. She pretended to follow him obediently before she ran towards the door like a crack of lightening. As soon as she exited the room, she realized something. She didn’t have the time to search for a knife in the kitchen. This large room was extremely wide, almost as if it was using up the entire floor. The moment she opened the door to the kitchen, his large arm wrapped around her hips.



Curses burst out between her teeth. She had believed that she couldn’t lose to anyone when it came to running, but it seemed that all those hours KyungHyun spent on the treadmill every night weren’t for nothing.
“Ugh…!”

“It seems that your recovery is getting better every day.”

KyungHyun easily lifted her into his arms and walked across the living room towards the bedroom. Unlike her panting breaths, KyungHyun’s breathing was calm and steady.
After having entered the bedroom, KyungHyun laid her down on the bed. When her back touched the mattress, he gently took her wrist and put it back into the handcuffs once again. EunHa heard the familiar click of the handcuff locking into place.
“Good night.”

KyungHyun picked up the glass of whiskey he had placed on the table and began to leave the room. Suddenly, EunHa spoke up in a hoarse voice. Her heart was racing so fast that she felt as if it was going to burst out of her throat.
“…Let’s talk.”

KyungHyun stopped in his tracks. This was the first time he had heard her voice in ten days. He slowly turned around with a calm expression on his face. Because her wrist was restricted by the handcuffs, she moved awkwardly as she tried to get up from the bed. KyungHyun walked up to her bedside and tenderly helped her sit up before sitting down next to her.
“I thought you went mute from the shock.”

“I just needed some time to sort through everything in my head.”



“So did you sort some things out?”

EunHa nodded.

“For the most part.” “Good.”
KyungHyun spoke apathetically next to her side. His hand was still on her hip, and she could feel his heat through the thin fabric. She could smell the faint aroma of whiskey.
“Is that Irish whisky?” “Yeah.”
“Can I have some?”

“A patient isn’t allowed to drink alcohol.”

She wanted to ask him if it was okay to handcuff a patient as well, but she suppressed that thought and softly spoke about something else instead.
“Fine. Then can you at least take these off?”

“Do you need your hands to talk? It’s not like I blocked your mouth.”
“I feel like I’m being interrogated, so it doesn’t feel that great. Please take them off.”
She lowered her eyes as she pleaded, but KyungHyun merely stared at her with his signature blank expression as he gave her a meaningful smile.
“Are you going to run away if I take them off?” “I won’t run away.”



“Then what were you trying to do just now? Were you playing a game of tag at this time of night?”
“I just wanted to make you feel a bit nervous, that’s all. It’s no fun if I’m too quiet.”
KyungHyun chuckled. He felt relieved to hear her voice after ten days, but he also felt the slow stirring of desire in his gut. Instead of staring blankly at the ceiling for hours on end, having her look straight back at him and running her mouth seemed to suit her a lot better.
“How do you feel?”

KyungHyun suppressed the urge to embrace her until her body almost broke and tried to calm himself.
“It hurts so much that I think I’m going to die.”

“The doctor said you were recovering well. Actually, he said you were recovering faster than normal.”
She thought that he was the type of person who wouldn’t understand when she was being sarcastic, but he took it in stride and gave her a dry rebuttal. She held back her own comeback and merely stared at him unhappily.
He was only wearing dark gray sweatpants. It looked like he had just gotten out of the shower because his hair was still damp. He wasn’t wearing a top. Because of this, she could clearly see his muscled chest and the tattoo that ran across his forearm to his back. She could tell that the tattoo hadn’t been achieved in a day. What was he thinking as he got that done?
“You’re pretty sharp. No wonder you’re police.”

“Do you feel repulsed now that you know I’m police?”



KyungHyun wet his lips with the glass of whiskey as he asked her.

“Yes, I don’t like police all that much. They’re so full of themselves.”
“What a pity.”

The ends of his lips calmly lifted as he stared at her. He didn’t look regretful at all. Even thought it seemed as though he’d loosened up in his personal space, he was still full of himself, and his attitude hadn’t changed. Now that she knew he was police, his personality seemed even dirtier than when she saw him as a gangster.
“What will happen to me now?” “What do you think?”
She still didn’t like the way he looked at her… as if he was trying to
figure her out. EunHa slightly pulled her head back.

“Will I be taken into custody? For the crime of shooting a gang leader?”
“You won’t go to prison. What you did is off the record.” “Then let me go.”
“What will you do if I let you go? Are you going to return to Serim and shoot at Kang SungHo this time?”
“No.”

“Your eyes tell me the opposite.”

“I won’t use a gun. I’m going to stab him with a knife.” “……”
“I’m going to hack and slash a few times. Just like that



bastard did to my parents.”

KyungHyun’s smile faded, and his brows furrowed. A silence settled in the room. Clink. He placed the glass of whiskey on the table, and the sound of the rattling ice rang inside the room.
“What happened to your parents is a shame. Along with everything else you had to go through after that.”
His Adam’s apple shook as he spoke. KyungHyun looked a bit more earnest now than he had just a moment ago. Did he pity her life? Yeah. Most people would be sympathetic of someone who had been living as a puppet for a man who had killed their parents.
Even though she knew he wasn’t a man who was easily overcome with emotion, she was grasping at straws right now. EunHa’s eyes tilted down as she looked at him before letting out a sigh.
“Then, can’t you… help me?”

She put her hand on his arm as she pleaded in a pitiful voice. She moved her fingers along the dragon on his arm as if she were counting each delicate scale. As her slender fingers moved down his arm, the veins in his neck became more pronounced.
“Don’t move your wounded arm.”

EunHa ignored his husky voice and slowly moved her free hand down his body.
She swept her palm down his hard, muscular chest. His skin felt hot and stiff. His long eyes narrowed and seemed to grow darker with desire as they watched her. EunHa softly whispered to him.
“You definitely said so. You said you’d help me kill Kang SungHo… Were you lying to me?”
“No.”



“Then let me go. I’ll do whatever you say.”

EunHa’s voice sounded pitiful as she gave him a feeble look. Please. Please, just… fall for it. Shin KyungHyun!
“No.”
“…Why not? Why can’t you let me go?” “Now isn’t the right time.”
Damn it. EunHa’s pitiful expression that seemed to suit a female lead of a tragic romance suddenly twisted and became fierce like an angry, wild animal. Her fingers clenched into a fist and she punched him hard in the chest.
“Don’t get too worked up. You’ll open your wound.”

She continued to punch him with all her might, but it was like punching a boulder. KyungHyun’s body didn’t move at all, so she became even angrier.
“I can deal with you acting like a spoiled child, but if you keep punching me like that, you’ll only hurt your hand.”
All the rage and fury she had been bottling up inside for the past ten days came bursting out. EunHa glared at KyungHyun’s calm face and grit her teeth as she spit out her response.
“This is why I hate the police. Only lies come out of their mouths, and all they care about is looking good in front of their superior officers. They’re all incompetent morons. How are you any different from all the thugs who cater to their bosses and obey them like dogs? ‘The people’s protector’ my ass. You can all die for all I care. I just told you I’d do the things you guys can’t do. I told you I’d kill those evil bastards and follow them all to hell!”



KyungHyun watched coldly as EunHa continued making her biting remarks.
“After enduring it all for 10 years, you can’t even wait the small amount of time it takes to lay a trap?”
“…What do you know? How dare you talk back?”

EunHa’s lips began to tremble on her pale face.

“Do you even know what I did these past 10 years?” “I know.”
“If you haven’t seen it with your own eyes, you don’t have a right to say you know.”
KyungHyun held her spiteful gaze and spoke in a low voice.

“I fully understand. When I joined the criminal organization, I had to do many dirty things as well.”
“How are you and I… even in similar situations? You chose that life, but I didn’t!”
“No, you did choose it.”

EunHa’s eyes filled with rage as her sorrowful tears began to drip out. These weren’t tears to entice him. These tears were truly filled with the unfairness she felt in her heart.
She chose it? When did she do that? Was he telling her that she chose to hold Kang SungHo’s hand and follow him without realizing he was her parents’ killer? She was overwhelmed with rage and humiliation that she began to grind her teeth. KyungHyun stared at her as he continued speaking in his low voice.
“You chose to survive.”



“…What?”
“You escaped that house with your own two feet. In order to live. You didn’t even realize that your ankle was half- broken and ran out of the house as if your life depended on it.”
He was talking about the incident 10 years ago. When she had risked her life to escape the house her parents had been murdered in. The tip of her small, sharp nose felt cold. Her eyes became cloudy as she looked up.
“You and I both decided to survive no matter what, so we came all the way here kicking and screaming, refusing to die.”
Even though KyungHyun’s expression was cold and his voice was like ice, his gaze on her seemed to be bursting with fireworks.
“So don’t treat that body you’ve worked hard to protect so poorly. I’ll help you. I’ll help you get your revenge. I’ll do it.”
His voice sounded sincere as he repeated himself. EunHa shook her head as if to shake that thought out of her head. Her bloodshot eyes glared at KyungHyun.
“You said that you were working at Serim around the time of my father’s death. Doesn’t that mean you were also a part of it?”
“I never knew Kang SungHo would kill your father.”

EunHa snorted and shook her head at his answer.

“Liar.”

“Do you really think Kang SungHo would have given an order like that to a rookie who just joined? Kang SungHo



killed all the underlings he took with him that night. Because he wanted to conceal his involvement and frame it on YongSung.”
“…Then why were you there that night?”

EunHa’s voice trembled towards the end of her question.

“I heard that Kang SungHo was moving in the middle of the night. It was strange, so I decided to run after him. When I finally realized what was going on, it was already too late.”
KyungHyun carefully answered her questions one by one. His expression looked serious, but he couldn’t shake off EunHa’s suspicions very easily.
“But if that bastard ordered you to kill my parents, you would have done it.”
KyungHyun immediately began to shake his head.

“I wouldn’t have done it.”

“If you’re going to lie about it now, forget it. Now that we know each others’ identities, there’s no need for you to try to look good in front of me.”
“There’s also no need for me to lie to you or make excuses.
I’m only telling you the truth.”

As KyungHyun frowned, his long eyes sharply tilted up. His normally calm voice now sounded furious.
“If I had known about Kang SungHo’s plans ahead of time, I would have subtly placed the evidence before your father and tried to take down the organization from the inside. Because that would have been an opportunity to destroy Serim in the long-term.”



EunHa began to bite her lips when she heard his answer. His large hand approached her, and his thumb touched her lips.
“Whether you believe me or not, that would have been my choice as a policeman.”
He grabbed her face and clearly repeated himself once more.

“I’ll let you kill Kang SungHo.” “Don’t give me that bullshit.”
EunHa scoffed at him with wet eyes. KyungHyun could understand why she didn’t believe him. However, that didn’t change anything.
“On the day of the founding party, I killed the bastard who shot you along with fourteen more of YongSung’s men.”
But he didn’t know whether telling her this would change her mind.

At the mysterious expression on KyungHyun’s face, doubt flashed across EunHa’s eyes. While she realized that it was thanks to KyungHyun she had been able to escape that situation with merely an injury, she hadn’t known that he had shot at the gangsters.
Why did he do it? Instead of shooting off her head and ending it once and for all, why did he risk revealing his true identity and do something like that?
“Do you still think I’m talking bullshit?”
“…Do you want to hear me thank you for saving my life?” “I didn’t do it to receive your gratitude.”
EunHa silently listened to his languid voice and became lost in thought. KyungHyun hadn’t been able to easily kill her because he was police. Just as he had 10 years ago when he instinctively saved her due to his profession.



“But if I ask for it, will you give it?”

KyungHyun swallowed, his throat dry. His Adam’s apple moved slowly. His naked upper chest was in full view because he didn’t have a top on. Every time he took a breath, his wide, hard chest rose up and down.
He was almost acting like a predator who was observing his prey. It was as if he was trying to figure out the right time to hunt. That’s right. Whether he was police or a thug, his sexual appetite hadn’t changed.
“……”

The moment she realized this fact, EunHa felt as if the temperature inside the room had risen. Her long eyelashes fluttered as she blinked and cast a shadow on her bare face. EunHa raised a hand and began to undo the buttons of her white, patient gown.
“What are you doing?”

KyungHyun’s low voice became even lower as it rang inside the room. Inside this large bedroom located at the top of this grand hotel, on top of the lonely bed… There was only the two of them.
“I want to pay you back for saving my life. Didn’t you just say that you wanted my gratitude?”
Pop, pop. Once the buttons became undone, the gown began to slide off, revealing her milky breasts. KyungHyun didn’t take his eyes off her chest as he asked.
“What do you mean by this?”
“…You want it right now. There’s no need to act innocent after everything we’ve done together.”
She wasn’t so naive as to misunderstand the gleam in a man’s



eyes when he desired a woman. Whether he was a gangster or a policeman, it didn’t matter. The only thing that was definite in this moment was that he desired her.
“Do you think that the price of saving your life is just one round of sex?”
His voice and his breaths betrayed his arousal. He frowned at her as he chuckled.
“It doesn’t matter to me. Take it or leave it.”

EunHa raised her hand and began to fondle her breast. With moist eyes, she sent him a tempting look. Her perky nipple thrust up between her fingers.
“Don’t just rake your eyes over it. Come and touch it yourself.”
“Is this how you want to repay me?” “Yes. I don’t like living in debt, you see.”
As soon as her whisper faded away, KyungHyun, who had not budged an inch all this time, slowly began to lean into her. The mattress began to sink, and the old springs began to creak.
“All right, then.”

He took one of his long fingers and slowly traced her face.

“If that’s what you want.”

As expected. EunHa slowly closed her eyes and opened them before giving him a faint smile.
“I want it.”

She felt that having a round of sex in exchange for saving her life



wasn’t a bad deal. Her body would just rot and return to the earth once she died, so using it to the max would only raise its value.
“…Is that so?”

KyungHyun wet his dry lips and replied in a husky, hoarse voice. She could feel his arousal through the heat coming from his finger on her cheek.
“I think I’ll also have to receive interest for saving your life 10 years ago. Is that okay?”
“Do whatever you want.” “You’re quite generous, aren’t you? “I’m not a stingy woman.”
She had already experienced his stubborn bedside manners in the past. How long would this bout of sex last this time? It didn’t matter, though. She’d repay him with this, and she felt that things would work in her favor if she just did what Shin KyungHyun wanted for now.
“Since you’re offering, I’ll happily take it.”

His proud nose tilted, and his eyes on her deepened.

“I’m not an idiot who rejects a full course meal, you see.” “Yes, all right.”
EunHa slowly blinked her eyes and gradually brought her face closer to his. No matter how many times she looked at it, his face was always attractive. If she did it with him, she wouldn’t be suffering a loss. His perfectly symmetrical lips began to move.
“But I’m very selfish, so there’s something I need from you.”



KyungHyun caught her gaze. His alcohol-laced breath smelled fragrant. EunHa opened her red lips and let out a soft sigh.
“I’ll do whatever play you want.” “You won’t regret it?”
“Do you want me to pinky promise?” “No, a kiss will do.”
EunHa lightly pecked his lips. KyungHyun let out a laugh.

“That’s good.”

“Tell me what you want.”

EunHa whispered as if she were a good child receiving a reward.
KyungHyun answered in a soft but clear voice. “From now on, until the day you die… “…Hmm?”
“Don’t have sex with any other man but me.”
TN: Uh oh… Do I smell a NSFW update coming up next? □





KyungHyun brushed his tongue over her frozen lips before he continued speaking.
“Whatever play you want to do… Only do it with Shin KyungHyun. What do you think?”
Unable to answer the unexpected question, EunHa merely stared into the deep abyss of his eyes.
“Seducing someone with a kiss, shaking your hips on top of a man, and ultimately sex… You’d do it all only with me.”
A peculiar feeling came over EunHa. Her throat was dry as she swallowed, and her heart began to race inside her chest.
“As for the threesome or swapping that you’ve mentioned before… Any third party is forbidden. I don’t like sharing my food. I’ll work harder to make up for the extra person, so give up on that idea.”
“Excuse me…”

When he heard her anxious voice, KyungHyun pressed his lips to hers and chuckled.
“Are you shocked?”

EunHa then realized that he was just telling a bad joke, but she wasn’t able to come up with a rebuttal as she normally would. KyungHyun’s gaze on her was as intense as always, but something



felt a bit different. It was sticky… like sugar water.
“Do you have to be so frozen over something like this?” “……”
“You’re the one who said you wanted to pay back your debt. If you act like this, I feel like I’m threatening you or something.”
He lightly bit her lips and plunged his tongue between them. The kiss didn’t feel any different than usual. However, something felt off. It felt strangely soft. EunHa pulled back her head and gave him a confused look.
“Uh… hmm…”

She didn’t have a chance to think of what to say. KyungHyun swallowed her lips again and entwined his tongue with hers. He caressed her face as he began to suck. After he rubbed her earlobe, he moved his finger behind her ear and brushed against the sensitive skin there. With his other hand, he pushed aside her undone gown and began to grope her exposed chest.
“Hmm… Mm…”

He put her nipples between his fingers just as she had done and began to stimulate them. At the same time, he massaged her breasts. The taste of whiskey began to slowly mix into her mouth. Like a graceful snake, KyungHyun’s tongue began to move inside her mouth. EunHa reflexively sucked.
“W…Wait a minute…”

She tried to push him away with her free hand, but he easily grabbed her wrist. KyungHyun took his lips off hers and looked at her with his terribly deep eyes.



“Why?”

Her heart began to race once again when she looked into his gaze. She was used to seeing the eyes of bewitched men. Whenever she saw it, she felt a sense of accomplishment or victory. However, when she saw them on Shin KyungHyun, she didn’t feel it at all. Instead, she felt strange.
“Why are you stopping me?”

KyungHyun brought his lips to the wrist he was holding. His lips pressed against her racing pulse. EunHa felt as if that spot was burning. There was still a faint bruise on the wrist from when he had tried to stop her from harming herself.
KyungHyun swept his tongue over the blueish bruise. She felt something warm and wet brush against the delicate skin, and it tickled. She felt strange. She hadn’t felt like this before.
“Does it hurt a lot here?”
“…I thought my wrist was going to snap.”

EunHa tried to hide her nervousness by speaking curtly, but KyungHyun’s reply was soft.
“Isn’t it better to have a broken wrist than to die?” “What are you talking about…”
“You can’t die. Not after everything I went through to save you.”
As he looked up and spoke in his languid voice, EunHa felt the blood rush to her face. Was it because it had been a while since they’ve done this? She couldn’t stop her heart from pounding inside her chest. No, more importantly, why was he acting so differently today? Didn’t his usual sex pattern start with him removing her



clothes and going down on her?

EunHa swallowed as KyungHyun repeatedly pressed kisses onto her wrist. He asked her as she continued to frown at him.
“Are you scared of me?” “…No.”
“Then why are you so tense and trembling?”

She was probably feeling strange and slightly trembling because of everything she had gone through recently. There was nothing deep when it came to sex with no strings attached. EunHa comforted herself as she murmured.
“Wh…Whatever, just do it.” “Alright, then.”
Her gaze got caught up in his deep eyes. She felt as if she were drowning in them. KyungHyun met her eyes and lowered his head. He thrust his face into her exposed chest. The lips that had been licking her slender wrist now fell onto her breast. He took out his long tongue and wrapped it around her dusky nipple that was peeking through his fingers.
At that moment, the light from the windows fell onto his face. This man looked incredibly sexy as he looked at her with his burning gaze, his mouth caressing her breast.
“Hnng…”

A faint moan escaped EunHa’s lips as the tip of his tongue teased her nipples. One of her wrists was handcuffed to the bed, and the other was gently within his grasp. Therefore, she couldn’t even grab onto his head.



“Please…” “Huh?”
KyungHyun flattened his tongue over her nipple as he asked. With her sensitive nipples teased so unbearably, EunHa thought she’d go crazy from the tickling sensation. She gasped for breath and spoke with a flushed face.
“Please suck it.”

She wanted to be sucked hard. Just like he usually did, she wanted him to grab both breasts in his hands and squeeze them as if they’d burst. Then she wanted him to nibble them before fiercely sucking them. However, KyungHyun was only softly licking them as if he were teasing her.
“Where?” “M…My chest…”
KyungHyun’s grasp on her breast slightly tightened. EunHa felt something warm trickle down from between her legs, tickling her. Her body began to tremble.
“If I suck it for you, will you do as I asked?” “What do you mean?”
Even his hot breaths on her chest stimulated her. As she panted, KyungHyun softly replied.
“I asked you to only fuck me.” “……”
“Why are you making me repeat myself?”

A faint smile stretched across his indifferent face. All the words



coming from his sculpted face sounded ridiculous to her.

“You asked me to suck it. Then it’s only fair that you only suck me.”
EunHa felt as if nothing mattered anymore. She nodded her flushed face and said what he wanted to hear.
“All right. Either way, I can only do it with you in this situation, so hurry… Hnng…!”
He fiercely sucked her perky nipple. He gave her breast a hard squeeze as if he’d been waiting for this. His tall nose pressed into her as he buried his face in her chest and began to suck.
“Haa, aagh…!”

The dizzying sensation coming from his tongue and teeth felt good. As she panted for breath, EunHa’s body began to shake. KyungHyun gave his attention to each breast repeatedly. Only when her nipples were tingling from his sucking and nibbling did KyungHyun finally lift his face.
“…Did it feel good?”

“What are you doing right now?”

EunHa asked as she gasped for breath. Her already-sensitive nipples began to throb as KyungHyun teased them between his fingers. She felt her panties sticking to her skin as they became drenched in her juices.
“What do you mean?”

“Hnng, why are you dragging this out?” “I’m trying to figure out what you like.”
“Yeah, I’m asking why you’re doing that all of a sudden.



You can just do it the way you normally do, hnng…”
KyungHyun pressed his fingers together. She felt as if he had pinched all the nerves in her body as the nipple between his fingers was squeezed. Her heart raced inside her chest and her mouth went dry. While she did feel like she’d lose her mind when he ripped off her underwear and licked her entrance, it was also very torturous when he went with the slow burn.
“We can’t have that.”
“I’m asking you why… Hnng…!”

“I want to make it so that you can’t reject me.”

KyungHyun’s black eyes contained a gleam of possessiveness and desire.
“But I’ve never rejected you.”

EunHa had to hold her breath from time to time in order to keep herself from moaning out.
“All right. Why don’t I put it this way. I want to make you want me.

Because she didn’t easily trust others, it wouldn’t be easy for her to open her heart to him. KyungHyun knew this very well.
“I think it’ll be pretty difficult, but I don’t think it’s impossible.”
EunHa frowned. She didn’t know what he was talking about.
“What are you saying…right now?”

“Just enjoy it. It’s fine if you don’t know.”

KyungHyun languidly murmured. For now, he wanted her body to open up only to him. So that she wouldn’t think of anything other



than wanting to have sex with him.

While it wasn’t a very heroic thing to do, he never claimed to be a gentleman, so he didn’t really care.
He licked her wrist that was still handcuffed to the bed. He pressed his teeth onto the delicate skin and began to suck. EunHa couldn’t stop the moan from escaping her lips. When he finally lifted his lips, a red mark was left behind. She felt as if every spot he touched had turned into an erogenous zone.
“Let’s kiss, EunHa.”

KyungHyun leaned in closer to her face and whispered in a soft voice. Hearing the way her name came out of his lips surprised her, but it also captivated her.
“If I kiss you… will you take off the handcuffs?”

She asked calmly as she tried to settle her heart. KyungHyun laughed softly as he gazed at her.
“We’ll see.” “Haa…”
EunHa tangled her tongue with his. As if he’d been waiting for this, KyungHyun followed her lead. It didn’t take long for the kiss to turn heated. As their teeth and tongues meshed together, their mouths began to make wet sounds.
As EunHa swallowed, she heard KyungHyun let out a husky groan. As they gazed into each other’s eyes, their tongues tangled together. It felt incredibly sexy. EunHa felt all the blood rush to her face.
“Ha, haa…”

Some saliva dripped down from her mouth. KyungHyun rubbed his



thumb over her jaw before licking it off. She felt dizzy. As his eyes became hotter and hotter, she felt as if her mind was going blank and her body was melting. He plunged his tongue back inside her mouth and nibbled on her lower lip. EunHa didn’t see an end in sight.
As the kiss grew longer, EunHa felt the spot between her legs grow wet. This was the first time she had become this wet just from a kiss. As her body shivered, she heard a soft metallic cling by her ear. KyungHyun had unlocked the handcuffs.
“It was good.”

KyungHyun wrapped his hand around her face as he murmured. EunHa decided to postpone her plan of running away as soon as she was released from the handcuffs. With both of her hands now free, she wrapped them around his neck and pressed her lips back onto his. She did this instinctively.
She felt KyungHyun’s breaths become choppier and his hand tighten on her face. EunHa felt relieved. That’s right. I want you to go crazy for me.
“Haa…”

When he lifted his lips off of hers, EunHa frowned as she panted. She didn’t want to think about anything. Her heart had become uncontrollable since a while ago and was now pounding against her chest almost to the point of pain. Her underwear was soaked, and she felt a throbbing ache between her thighs.
“I want to do it.” This was the truth. “Let’s do it now.” “Not yet.”



KyungHyun shook his head as he interrupted her. Then he lowered his face to the sensitive spot behind her ear and kissed down her neck. EunHa mewled like a kitten and felt the him suck harder. Red marks trailed along the collarbone and shoulder of her uninjured side.
“Why… Why… Hnng…”

When she moaned out resentfully, KyungHyun slid his hand inside her pants. Her underwear was already a mess due to her juices. He lifted her underwear and pushed his hand inside. KyungHyun stroked her soft, hot entrance.
“You’re drenched.”

“Are you, hnng, teasing me right now?”

EunHa flinched and trembled as she mumbled. KyungHyun frowned as he laughed. He lightly tapped his fingertips against her, causing her to melt.
“No. I want to ram inside you so hard that it’s driving me insane.”
“Then can’t you just do it…?”

When she asked him in disbelief, KyungHyun finally began to caress her swollen clitoris.
“Tonight is our first night together, so I can’t do that.”

Unable to understand his choice of words, EunHa frowned in her aroused state. They’d already slept together twice, so what did he mean by ‘first night’? No, more importantly, they didn’t have the type of relationship where they had a ‘first night’.
“This is the first time we’re having sex after we’ve bared everything to each other and have nothing left to hide.”



As if he’d read her mind, KyungHyun softly murmured as he lightly pressed her sensitive clitoris.
“What… a… ridiculous… hnng…”

“Like you said before, despite how I look, I’m quite old- fashioned. Something like that hits hard with me.”
Warm fluids continued to flow out of her damp entrance. EunHa’s mouth went dry as her body burned.
“I want to make you lose your mind. So that you can never forget me.”
“Then don’t just tickle me slowly… And just…”

“Do you want me to put my finger inside? Or do you want me to put my lips on you and suck?”
Her juices had already dripped down onto her thighs. There was no way KyungHyun didn’t know what she wanted at this point. Her walls were throbbing and aching inside her, screaming out for some kind of stimulation.
“Put… your finger inside… immediately.”

EunHa grit her teeth and blurted it out. KyungHyun chuckled softly.
“What… What’s so funny?”

“I just thought that you were cute to be giving orders at a time like this.”
As he said these ridiculous words, KyungHyun pulled off her underwear and pants in one fell swoop. Just as EunHa was thinking that anything would be good as long as he penetrated her throbbing entrance, KyungHyun lowered his head and pressed his soft tongue and lips against her instead of inserting his finger.



If he was going to do this from the start, why did he even ask her to choose? A cry left her lips.
“Hnnng…!”

His lips and tongue weren’t rough as he began to suck at juices.
Like a child licking candy, he softly lapped at her entrance.
“Ah…!”

EunHa clearly felt her insides quiver as she grew wetter. As her entrance twitched, it began to open and close repeatedly. KyungHyun continued to make wet noises as if he were doing so intentionally.
As his lips and tongue continued to brush against her, EunHa felt an unbelievable pleasure run up her body. She felt that if he only sucked a little harder, she’d be able to reach her peak… At that moment, KyungHyun took his lips off of her.
“Should I put my finger in now?”
“Haa… Seriously, why are you doing this to me?”

EunHa looked like she was going to cry. KyungHyun stuck out his long tongue and began to lap at her juices like a dog.
“If you don’t like it, should we stop?”

With his mouth wet with her juices, KyungHyun had the audacity to say those words. She wanted to smash his smirking face. That wasn’t a bad idea. EunHa frowned as her face flushed with frustration.
“If you’re going to be like that, just stop… Hnng!” Suddenly, KyungHyun inserted his finger inside her. “Here.”



Although she was furious that he was acting like an adult who was putting candy into a child’s mouth, EunHa couldn’t push him away. His long middle finger plunged inside her wet entrance and softly caressed her. EunHa’s hips twitched. Her walls were squeezing his finger so tightly. KyungHyun spoke up in awe.
“You feel incredibly hot and soft right now.”

With his finger still inside her, he raised his body over hers. He was careful not to completely put his full weight on top of her because of her injured shoulder.
“Are you this aroused because you want me?” “Hnng…!”
Too tired to beg, EunHa turned her face away from him. She saw the veins bulging on his arm as he gripped the edge of the mattress. Even though she was sure he was completely delirious with desire, she didn’t know why he was acting so relaxed.
“Are you upset with me because I got you worked up?”

KyungHyun inserted another finger.

“Don’t be mad. If you make that face, it only makes me want to see you cry out even more.”
“You… haa… have a horrible personality. You know that, right?”
Every time his fingers moved inside her, EunHa heard wet noises fill the room.
“You’ve been teasing me all this time, so now it’s my turn.” KyungHyun placed a kiss on her cheek and whispered into her ear. “…Do you know who cleaned every nook and cranny of



your body while you were unconscious?”

EunHa felt that she knew the answer. Instead of answering, she let out a sigh. KyungHyun pecked her face as he continued speaking.
“I almost forgot you were a patient and nearly jumped on top of you.”
He plunged his fingers into her so deeply that his knuckles almost disappeared inside her. KyungHyun softly wiggled his middle finger and his ring finger. EunHa’s hips flinched and began to shake. As he stimulated her walls, EunHa wanted to cry out from the intense ecstasy. Her entrance tightened around him.
“I wasn’t able to hold myself back and kissed you over here.”
KyungHyun’s voice was slightly tinted with laughter. As she imagined him burying his face between her legs while she was asleep, EunHa’s body flushed. As expected of a pervert.
“Even though you were asleep, you were as wet as you are now. It was difficult to pull myself away.”
“Hnng…!”

As he pulled out his fingers, a groan burst out of her lips. KyungHyun licked and sucked his fingers that were drenched with her juices. Realizing that the peculiar smell filling the room was coming from her own body, EunHa felt as if she was going to lose her mind.
“I’ve been wanting to do this for the past ten days you didn’t talk.”
He murmured in a husky voice.

“Every time our eyes met, my body would tense up because it



wanted to have sex with you.’

“You already had me in handcuffs. Haa, why didn’t you just force yourself on me?”
EunHa stared at him as she panted. She watched as he took off his sweat pants. After he had taken out his fingers, she almost couldn’t bear the empty feeling inside. KyungHyun tossed his pants and underwear beneath the bed and began to approach her. His cock angrily stood out from his course pubic hair.
“I’m not a thug. I’m police, so I don’t take women by force.
I don’t want to ram into a dry, stiff pussy either.” “Haa…”
He sure as hell sounded like a thug right now. But because this man had a bad temper, EunHa was afraid he’d stop his movements if she said anything, so she kept her thoughts to herself. As his knee pressed between her thighs, EunHa readily opened her legs for him. When his stiff cock brushed against her damp entrance, Eunha’s body trembled in anticipation.
“But I did relieve myself in other ways.”

The head of his cock was already wet with precum. He continued to rub it along her seam as if he were assessing her reaction.
“As I imagined you crazy from wanting me, as I recalled how it felt when I thrust and ground myself into you… I jerked myself off. Morning and night.”
It didn’t matter what he did anymore. EunHa felt as if she’d lose her mind and moaned through her teeth.
“Ha, uh…”

“EunHa.”



KyungHyun softly whispered in her ear as she struggled for breath.

“Should we do it now?”

She felt as if her whole body was burning.

“Should I put it in? Is that what you want?”

His penis continued to rub against her entrance. With a flushed face, EunHa bit her lip and nodded. KyungHyun laced their fingers together with both hands. His hands were damp with sweat.
“Tell me you want me.”

His low, baritone voice captivated her. EunHa put their hands straight above her head. She looked up at him with her reddened face and panted out a whisper.
“Excuse me…” “Yeah?”
KyungHyun’s lips stretched into a smile. EunHa narrowed her eyes and spit out her words.
“…If you’re not going to put it in right this instant, can you get lost? I’ll just do it myself.”
While it was a far cry from what he had ordered her to say, it was enough to make him lose his last shred of reason.
“…What?”

“Guys aren’t the only ones who can do it on their own, you know.”
TN: KH is trying to set the mood, but EH isn’t having it □







KyunHyun let out a hiss through his teeth. Once the lewd picture popped into his head, he couldn’t control himself any longer. Even if other people mocked him and said that he was whipped by a young woman, he wouldn’t have anything to say.
“I’ll definitely have to see that for myself next time.” “I said get lost…!”
Unable to take it anymore, EunHa glared at him. KyungHyun roughly captured her lips and began to suck. At the same time, his throbbing cock entered her damp entrance in one thrust.
“Hmm…!”

A muﬄed cry escaped EunHa’s lips as her body shook. As he felt her squeeze him, KyungHyun let out a groan as his tongue invaded her mouth.
Her soft and sticky walls sucked him in. KyungHyun was no longer in a playful mood. As he began to thrust in and out, EunHa automatically lifted her hips to receive him.
KyungHyun slid out and rammed back in to the hilt. Even though he hadn’t been thrusting for too long, his penis was already drenched in her fluids as it grew thicker.
Because he was moving slowly, her walls felt each stimulation very clearly. As he repeatedly pressed into her and slowly rubbed her as he pulled out, EunHa felt the pleasure build up in her lower belly.



“Ah, aaah…!”
Her inner thighs began to tremble. As she struggled to tightly hold on to him, KyungHyun’s hands, which were still intertwined with hers, tightened their grip.
“Don’t move your arm. It’ll hurt because of the circulation.”

Because he wasn’t pressing down on her with his weight, their hands and their lower halves were the only points of connection between them.
“I’m fine, so… hnng…”

Unable to finish her sentence, EunHa let out a moan. KyungHyun slowly pumped his hips into her as he whispered in a hoarse voice.
“I’m holding back the urge to ram into you right now. It’s almost unbearable. But this feels crazy good too. I can feel every single one of your reactions so clearly.”
“Hnng, aaah…”

Was this what it felt like when your body was boiling? Instead of holding onto him with her arms, she wound her legs around his hips and pressed him closer to her. KyungHyun slid even deeper inside her, and she could feel him lightly tap against her sweet spot.
“You like it here.”
“Aahng! If you keep pressing there like that… Aaah!”

Pleasure zinged up her body as his blunt tip continued to rub that spot. EunHa let out a lewd cry. Covered in a creamy fluid, KyungHyun’s penis was gripped so tightly that KyungHyun couldn’t help but let out a hoarse moan.
“Hm…”



“Hnng, aahng, aaah!”

As she looked up at him with a flushed face, she gasped for breath. KyungHyun sucked her lower lip as he continued to thrust into her. Then his soft tongue entered her mouth and entwined with hers.
As they sucked each others tongues, EunHa swallowed. KyungHyun tilted his head, and their lips fit together perfectly. Neither of them closed their eyes.
As the sound of their wet kissing filled the room, moans continued escaping from between the seam of their lips. Their movements were in sync as the pleasure built up inside both of them. KyungHyun tightly held onto her hands as he began to suck harder. Their breaths mingled together.
They kissed until their faces were completely flushed. KyungHyun gave her a final wet kiss before parting his lips from hers. No, that wasn’t completely true. He continued to press his wet lips against her flushed face as he began to sprinkle light kisses.
EunHa couldn’t remember how many times they’d kissed tonight. Since before they began having sex, she felt that the time his lips were on her skin was longer than the time it wasn’t.
“Haa…”

KyungHyun let go of one of her hands and slipped his hand underneath her. His hand felt hot as it gripped her bottom. Once he was completely inside her, he began to piston in and out without pressing down onto her upper body.
“Ah, aah… Nng…!”

With every thrust, their combined fluids began to run down his penis. EunHa was so wet that her juices slid down her bottom and dripped onto KyungHyun’s fingers.



“Do you like it that much? Why are you so wet?” “Isn’t it better for you if I’m wet?”
EunHa gasped out. Her unfocused eyes delighted KyungHyun. He pressed even deeper inside her and whispered hoarsely.
“It’s better. It feels so good that I think I’m going to lose my mind. This is the first time I’ve felt like I’ve completely melted.”
Even though the lights were turned off, EunHa could clearly make out his face thanks to the city lights coming in through the window. Like him, the room was desolate. Inside this empty room, KyungHyun didn’t hide his desire for her. For some reason, this felt so sensual to EunHa.
“Did you fall for me?”

KyungHyun asked, causing EunHa to frown. It was true that her body was burning to the point of insanity. KyungHyun pulled her flushed earlobes into his mouth and began to suck. EunHa stuttered out her reply.
“Haa, I… honestly like, hnng, the sex.”

Sweat dripped down KyungHyun’s forehead as he continued thrust into her.
“Just the sex?”
“Haahng! Y…Your face too.” “What?”
His eyes narrowed as he smiled.
“I’m pretty superficial, so… I’m picky, haa, about people’s looks… Hnng!”



KyungHyun had lowered his lips from her ears down to the sensitive part of her neck, causing EunHa to moan at the end of her sentence.
“I like everything about you.”

She felt his breath brush her sensitive skin as he spoke in a captivating voice.
“I think I’m going crazy because of it.”

His thrusts quickened, and EunHa’s mind began to go blank. As her entrance repeatedly opened and closed in on his penis, she continued to drench him with her juices. With hands damp with sweat, they frantically held on to each other. Every time KyungHyun rammed into her, his coarse pubic hair rubbed against her throbbing clitoris.
“Ah, aaah!”

EunHa’s inner thighs trembled. The orgasm that suddenly ripped through her was deep and long. KyungHyun ground himself deeply into her a few more times. When he saw the pleasure ripple through her face, KyungHyun finally let go. As their hot breaths brushed over each others’ necks, the evidence of their pleasure flowed out of her entrance.
Even though the handcuffs were gone, EunHa couldn’t lift a finger. All she could do was gasp for breath as she lied on the bed. It seemed that she had lost a lot of stamina due to being in bedridden for a few days. After ejaculating a few times, KyungHyun got up and disappeared into the bathroom. He came back out with a damp towel. He began to clean her between her legs. The damp towel felt soothing.
“I can do that myself.” “Stay still.”



“Excuse me?” “Stop squirming.”
After wiping her clean, he began to clean his wet penis as well. He carelessly tossed the towel onto the table after he was done. Still nude, KyungHyun lied down next to her on the bed. The old mattress let out a soft groan.
“Excuse me, there’s not a lot of room here.” “This is actually my bed, you know.”
For the past ten days, he had given EunHa his bedroom and slept on the sofa bed in the living room. However, he didn’t plan on doing that anymore.
“Then I’ll leave. I can’t sleep in such a narrow bed like this.”
“Then do you want to sleep on top of me?” “What are you saying…”
Clink, the handcuffs were put on her once again. This time, she wasn’t cuffed to the bedpost. Seeing that her left hand was now handcuffed to KyungHyun’s right hand, EunHa frowned.
“What do you think you’re doing?”

“It’s best if you don’t move around too much until you’ve fully recovered.”
“If you wanted me to make a full recovery, you shouldn’t have had sex with me like that.”
“Aren’t you the one who started it?”

KyungHyun laughed softly in the dark. Unable to say anything to



that, EunHa kept her mouth shut.

“Whatever the case, it was good.”

EunHa didn’t reply to him and merely swallowed. It was good for her as well. She had been mindlessly drunk with pleasure.
She could feel his gaze on her without having to turn her head. She wanted to turn the other way, but because of the handcuffs, she wasn’t able to. In addition, the bed was so narrow that she might have fallen off if she did.
“I’m beginning to think that this is the reason why you saved my life.”
EunHa mumbled.

“What do you mean?”
“Haa… Aren’t you planning on tying me down like this and satisfying your lust until you get tired of me?”
KyungHyun’s lips stretched into a smile in the dark.

“Do you think you’ll get tired of having sex with me?”

When EunHa hesitated to answer, KyungHyun didn’t wait for her response and continued talking.
“I don’t think I’ll get tired of it. The more we do it, the more our bodies sync together. It feels good.”
“…The official term for that is sexual compatibility.” “So?”
A hint of laughter could be heard in his voice. However, EunHa didn’t catch that and frowned.



“Has anyone ever told you that you have a sex addiction? That you lose focus at the weirdest times…
“No, this is the first time I’m hearing of it.”

“How strange. At this rate, I don’t think any woman will want to be by your side.”
“It’s probably because you’re so addicting that you make a man lose his focus.”
EunHa let out a sigh. Having been locked up in here for the past two weeks, her reflection in the mirror showed an empty shell of a person as if to prove that beauty was a sin. Her appearance didn’t look close to sexy. However, it seemed that this man definitely had strange tastes.
“You had many opportunities to have sex with me until now. Why didn’t you take them?”
“Why? Are you disappointed that I haven’t been cultivating our sexual compatibility for the past couple of weeks?”
“Have you lost your mind? I was just wondering how you were able to bear it these past several days.”
KyungHyun laughed softly as he looked into her glaring eyes. Inside this moonlit room, KyungHyun’s laughter resounded off the walls. As the naked couple stuck to each other in the narrow single bed, the mattress creaked.
“Seriously, that’s not true.”

She had been thinking of nothing but running away once she could think straight, but now what was this pervert talking about?
“All right.”



He gazed at the huffing woman next to him, and there was still a lingering laugh in his voice.
“Didn’t I tell you the reason why I endured it?”

He had said that he didn’t force himself on her because he was police, but then he… Either way, before curses left her lips again, EunHa quickly spoke up to intercept those thoughts.
“Fine. I remember.”

KyungHyun softly touched her handcuffed hand. He brought her cold, slender hand into his warm one and began to knead it.
“While you were asleep, the doctor asked me to avoid having any intense exercise with you for a while.”
“Does the whole neighborhood know that you’re sleeping with me?”
“The people that work with me are incredibly observant and cunning.”
“They sound reliable.”

This was the honest truth. Given that this man next to her was their leader, it was obvious. At her lingering words, KyungHyun replied in a low voice.
“I had to restrain myself because I was afraid I’d be too rough with you once I got started.”
“Well… your style just now was quite soft. Except… at the end.”
EunHa replied as she stared up at the ceiling. KyungHyun asked back.
“So did you hate it?”



As he listlessly watched her, EunHa felt that she didn’t have to see his face to know what he looked like right now. Without waiting for her answer, KyungHyun spoke once again.
“I liked it.” “……”
“It was pretty unbearable because I had to hold back a lot, but your reaction was hot. Just putting it in felt electrifying.”
Just as she thought, he was definitely a pervert. Even though she didn’t want to think too much into the ridiculous words he was saying, something felt off since a while ago. Even after they finished having sex, he insisted on staying right next to her as he commented on how good it felt. It felt awkward and odd. The same went for the way he was massaging her hand with his, the way his warm hand felt on hers. EunHa blinked and opened her mouth to change the subject.
“…Then undo these handcuffs as my reward.”

“Why? So that you can play tag in the middle of the night again?”
His hand tightened on hers.

“Be honest. I’m not being much of a help by staying here. If anyone from YongSung finds out, it’ll only put you in a difficult position.”
“Officially, we’ve told them that you’ve killed ten of YongSung’s men at the founding party, and that you were brought over here to me so that you could be eliminated.”
Basically, he had announced to them that she was going to die. She suddenly felt as if all the air had left the room. EunHa breaths became silent as the temperature dropped.



“Does… Kang SungHo also think I’m dead?” “No. He knows that you’re alive.”
“……” “For now.”
EunHa swallowed when she heard his ambiguous words.

“Don’t think about going back to Serim.”

KyungHyun spoke softly as if he’d read her mind. EunHa quickly turned her head and looked at him. Now that her eyes had become accustomed to the dark, she could clearly see KyungHyun’s sharp face. KyungHyun looked back at her unblinkingly and repeated himself.
“I have no plans of sending you back to that bastard.” “…Why not?”
“Because it’s dangerous.”

There was only one reason why KyungHyun told SungHo that EunHa was still alive. It was to warn him of what was to come.
It wasn’t that SungHo didn’t want to tell KyungHyun to return to Serim, it was that he couldn’t. KyungHyun had already grown in power, and SungHo was starting to feel afraid. The animosity between them had already reached its limit, and it was only a matter of time before the bubble burst.
KyungHyun actually thought that it was for the best. It was better that they had this happen before his trip to China. It would be easier to begin an outright attack on SungHo as an enemy.
As KyungHyun brushed away these thoughts, he tightened his grip on EunHa’s hand as she tried to pull it away. Clink. The metallic



ringing of the handcuffs filled the room.
“…If I don’t go back, I won’t be able to kill him.”

“I’ll capture Kang SungHo and bring him to you. I promise.” “I don’t trust anything the police says.”
“It doesn’t matter if you don’t believe me. Either way, you won’t be going back to Serim.”
She felt as if she was speaking to a wall. EunHa’s raised her voice in frustration.
“…Why are you doing this to me? Why does it matter to you whether I live or die? Don’t tell me it’s because you’re police. You told me yourself that a truckload of people have died by your hands already!”
KyungHyun looked at her in silence. Not wanting to lose, EunHa glared into his intense gaze.
“Do you really not know the reason?”

KyungHyun finally opened his mouth. EunHa frowned. She took a deep breath as she glared at him.
“You have a good head on your shoulders. You’re pretty smart, so why can’t you figure it out?”
“I don’t know.”

“I told you I don’t want you to be in danger.” “I’ve lived my life like that way before I met you.” “Then stay in my shadow and live in safety.” “And why do I have to do that?”



EunHa asked in disbelief. His hand felt hot as it grasped hers. Their bodies were sweaty, but because they were stuck together, she couldn’t tell where the sweat was coming from. KyungHyun kept his deep eyes on her and replied. He murmured in a soft voice as his gaze intimidated her.
“I’ll only say this once, so listen closely.” “……”
“You asked me why I cared whether you live or die even though I’ve killed a truckload of people. Isn’t it obvious? How could your life possibly compare to the lives of thug bastards?”
She didn’t understand his shameless words. Being a member of Serim, she hadn’t lived a clean life either. She had probably done all the things any member of YongSung had done as well. When he saw that she was still looking at him in confusion, KyungHyun let out a long sigh.
“I have romantic feelings for you.” What was this man saying all of a sudden? EunHa frowned at his unexpected words.
“For the first time in my many years of life, I’ve finally met a woman I want to be with. Do you think I’m the type of guy who’s okay with letting his woman get into any danger? Well, I don’t think I am.”
EunHa’s lips slightly parted. She couldn’t think of anything to say in this situation. KyungHyun spoke in a calm voice.
“Are you shocked? You look troubled.”

EunHa’s frown was still frozen on her face. KyungHyun looked at



her and brushed his tongue over her lips. With his eyes still on her, KyungHyun spoke up in a husky voice.
“Do you not like me?”

EunHa blinked furiously, completely at a loss for words. She didn’t know how to reply to his confession. Before she first approached Shin KyungHyun, this had been her plan. She was trying to make him fall for her completely so that she could get information out of him.
However, everything had failed, and things were different now. The reason why she couldn’t scoff and tell him to stop joking around was because she could tell that KyungHyun was completely serious. Knowing him, he was being like this because he didn’t want her to claim that he was making a bad joke.
“…Whether I like you or not, I don’t have any romantic feelings for you, Director.”
EunHa barely managed to open her mouth and reject his feelings, but KyungHyun merely chuckled. With his free hand, he wrapped it around her hips and embraced her. He nuzzled her ear with his tall nose.
“You must be very surprised. It’s been a while since I’ve heard you call me ‘Director’.”
EunHa then realized that she had been so shocked that she had called him by his fake title.
“You didn’t even blink an eye when I asked if you wanted to have sex, but now that I’m asking you if we can go out, you’re acting as if you’ve been burned.”
Stuck in his embrace, she could hear the sound of a pounding heart. Was this her own heartbeat or was it coming from this smiling man?



“We don’t have to date, so have sex with me one more time, EunHa.”
“……”

“Even if you don’t like me, you said you liked the sex.”

Was that really okay with him? Even though he’d been rejected, his face didn’t show any sign of disappointment as it approached her own. Bewildered, EunHa pulled her head back. His hands wrapped around her cheeks.
“You said that you at least liked the way I looked.”

With her own words thrown back at her, EunHa couldn’t think of anything to say. His hot breaths puffed against her neck before his lips pressed onto the sensitive skin. Once again carried away by his hands, EunHa could only blink in confusion.
“It doesn’t matter if you have romantic feelings for me or not. I don’t feel the same way.”
“Did I say anything?”

KyungHyun asked calmly. EunHa was at a loss for words. She also felt that it would be ridiculous to reject having sex with him because of a few trivial words.
“Do you feel frustrated because your heart is beating like a little kid’s after what I said?”
“…Of course not.”

As KyungHyun lowered his handcuffed hand, the metallic chains clinked together. He gazed at her softly and whispered in a low voice.
“Then just act like you always do. Don’t be so frozen stiff.”

She could feel his desire through his hand. She let out a helpless



laugh.

“All right.”

Such a one-sided confession. She felt that it suited a man like him. She softly grasped his penis that was already wet with precum. As she slowly caressed it, KyungHyun bit his lower lip.
“Ha… Feels good.”

She found it laughable that she didn’t hate how he bared all the hidden darkness inside of him for her to see. After making sure he was completely erect, she climbed on top of him.
“What’s so good? Me?”

She blurted out the words that had been troubling her since a while ago. KyungHyun groaned in a hoarse voice. He grabbed her bottom with his free hand.
“Come here. Stop fooling around.”

Having lost all composure, he spread her open and rammed into her. EunHa laughed as she began to slowly rock her hips. Even though this was all unexpected, it didn’t feel that bad.
“Since when?” “What?”
“Since when did you start liking me?”

“Why do you want to know about something like that?” “I’m curious about stuf like that.”
As she panted above him, KyungHyun pulled her down to his chest as he continued to thrust inside her. EunHa was now lying on top of him, face-to-face.



“Guess.”

“When I asked you to kiss me at the traditional Korean restaurant?

“Before that.”

KyungHyun ground into her as he licked her lips. EunHa’s eyes widened as she stared down at him.
“Before? When?”
“…When you first started working.”

“But you were glaring at me so fiercely in your office as you threatened me. That’s when it happened?”
“I wasn’t threatening you. I was warning you. So that you wouldn’t seduce me.”
“You’re the one who fell for me all on your own, so why were you blaming me?”
With his lips pressed to hers, KyungHyun chuckled softly.

“That’s not when I fell for you.”

“Then when was it? That was my first day of work.”

“It was when I overheard you say that you were very wet because you weren’t able to fuck Shin KyungHyun through the bug in your apartment.”
She remembered saying that to YongJoon in order to excite him.
But who knew that KyungHyun would fall for her instead?

“I thought I’d go crazy. From wanting to do this.”

He was definitely a strange man. KyungHyun seemed to become more aroused as he thought about that time. Still inside her, he



flipped her body over so that he was now on top.

“You’ve endured it well.”

KyungHyun laced the fingers of their handcuffed hands together.

“Do you want to know how I endured it?”

Without waiting for her response, KyungHyun lowered his forehead onto hers.
“That night, after I called you, on the sofa…”

He began to whisper the events of that night. After he told her how he had masturbated to her on her first day of work, EunHa quickly covered his mouth with her hand.
“How much longer will I have to listen to what you did when you were alone?”
He pulled one of her fingers into his mouth and nibbled it.

“I did that for half a month. I thought I was going crazy.” “So?”
“After I fed you that night, I planned on taking you back to the hotel.”
“So when you asked me to eat dinner with you, that was a date?”
“Did you really not know that?”

He spoke so certainly that EunHa scoffed in disbelief. “I thought it was just a company dinner.” “Then why did you seduce me on our walk?”



“Because it felt dangerous. When you caught that mosquito, I thought you were going to kill me instead.”
KyungHyun caressed her hips with a warm hand as he laughed.

“That night, I planned on sleeping with you no matter what. And you seduced me by asking for a kiss in that situation. Then some son of a bitch came and ruined the mood by making us roll around in the dirt. Can you imagine how pissed off I was?”
Just when EunHa was going to ask if his behavior of bursting into someone else’s apartment was any better, KyungHyun swallowed her lips. Her breaths mingled with his. The handcuffs connecting their hands together continued to rattle throughout the night.






During the past 3 weeks of EunHa’s recovery, KyungHyun only left her a total of seven times. Whenever he did leave her, he made sure to handcuff her once again and sent General Manager Cha to keep watch over her.
EunHa had tried to seduce General Manager Cha as well, but he didn’t fall for any of it. It seemed that he was an old-fashioned, diligent public servant.
With the exception of her request to be set free, KyungHyun fulfilled all of her wishes. He had even gone and bought her some women’s underwear on his way home. When he was home, he was either lost in thought for long stretches of time or spoke in a serious tone with General Manger Cha outside the room.
However, when the sun set, he always embraced her without fail. EunHa had complained that she would lose stamina due to being locked inside this room, and so KyungHyun kept her panting and sweating through sex.
Thankfully, after the night he confessed to her, he never mentioned it again. Instead, KyungHyun passionately embraced her every night. When the light of dawn began to creep into the room through the windows, he embraced her from behind and slipped his hand into her panties, effectively waking her up.
There was even a time when he had been watching her shower as he leaned on the doorframe, smoking a cigarette. Then he walked into the shower, still clothed, and began to have sex with her, not caring about the water drenching his clothes.
After that strange ‘first night’, KyungHyun took every opportunity



he could to explore every nook and cranny of her body with his tongue, driving her into a frenzy.
“Shin KyungHyun-ssi, I’m sorry to ask, but were you always a man with this much free time?”
“I have enough time to roll around with you.” “Why don’t you do it on your own sometimes?”
“Are you asking me because you want to see me masturbate? I have some time now to satisfy your curiosity.”
“…No thank you. Don’t do it. I won’t look. Ah… Please.”

As the time EunHa spent within this room grew longer, the more anxious she became. On the other hand, KyungHyun seemed more relaxed as he calmed her down. After a long round of sex, he would embrace her limp body and enjoy some listless afterplay as he told her stories she didn’t ask to hear.
For example, he told her a story of the time when he had just joined Serim and was sent out into the field. He had never used a weapon other than a gun before, so he had been very confused when he had to use a knife, hammer, or a club to fight his way out of a brawl. However, when he realized that he was actually pretty good at it, he told her that it didn’t feel bad at all. EunHa listened to his absurd stories and felt that they seemed to suit him perfectly.
“When did you get this?”

Inside the bathtub, EunHa rubbed the tattooed waves on his upper chest. KyungHyun was holding her as they faced each other. He was stroking her bottom, and whenever he moved his arm, the dragon on his arm twitched as if it were alive.
“Immediately after I graduated the police academy and was assigned to infiltrate Serim.”



“Did your superiors order you to get something like this?”

“Someone said something in passing that pissed me off, so I put in a lot more effort than necessary. But even then, I never expected it to turn out like this.”
“What did they say?”

“I heard someone say that I didn’t look like a thug but more like an arrogant member of the elite and that I needed to change up my style.”
EunHa frowned as she snorted.
“…Elite?”

“Why? You don’t believe me?”

KyungHyun asked calmly. EunHa didn’t doubt that he could do his work well. Whatever he did, he did it perfectly. It was just that…
“It’s just… I can’t imagine you wearing a police uniform.”

Wearing his expensive suits with a cold expression on his face, he seemed to be a businessman who committed crimes as naturally as he ate food.
“Same here. It was so long ago.”

“Maybe this was your calling instead of being a policeman.” 
“Maybe.”

KyungHyun faintly smiled. Even though his smile was cold, his body felt extremely hot. Even now, EunHa felt that she was only seeing one side of this man. No, could anyone truly know someone completely? She hadn’t even known the truth about her family even though they had been extremely close.



“…I want to ask you something.” EunHa hesitated before asking. “What is it?”
“When you first entered Serim…”
Her voice shook slightly due to her anxiety. She had wanted to ask him this for a while now, but she had always held back.
“Did you see my dad often?”

KyungHyun remained silent for a moment before opening his mouth.
“I was always out in the field, so I didn’t have a lot of opportunities to see him. Your father’s position was too high for him to come out very often. My team was also observing someone else at the time.”
“Ah, I see.”

Her voice carried a slight hint of disappointment. KyungHyun pulled her closer to him and rubbed her hair which now smelled like his shampoo.
“Are you curious about what your dad was like in Serim?” “…Yes, you’re right. When I was young, I never even
imagined that my dad was in the mob. Honestly, I can barely
even imagine it now.”

“He definitely gave me the impression of being someone who was far removed from the rest of the thugs. That’s probably why he was mainly in charge of the business side of things. Even on our side, he was second on the list of people to keep our eye on. The first being the leader. He was even



above Kang SungHo.”

EunHa let out a deep sigh as she listened carefully. This was the first time she was hearing about how her father was the the criminal organization from someone other than SungHo.
“But you father wanted to give up on everything a few times.”
“…What do you mean?”

Hearing this for the first time, EunHa’s eyes widened as she stared at him. Recognizing the longing inside her eyes, KyungHyun slowly replied in a soft voice.
“Your father was two positions above the man we were watching.”
“…So?”

“He said that your father was a man who constantly talked about his family.”
EunHa, who had been pretending to stay calm, stared at him as her eyes began to tremble. She wanted to hear more about this side of her father that she never knew.
“In the beginning, he had nothing, so he came to Seoul and entered Serim. He did everything he was told to do, but… After a certain point, he was constantly scared something would happen to his family. Whenever he got drunk, I heard that he always joked about retiring early and setting up an orchard somewhere far away.”
“EunHa, should we move here? Do you want to live here?
Then we can eat all the fruit that you like so much.”

EunHa bit her lip as she remembered a memory from long ago. Her



family had gone somewhere for vacation. How had she answered that question? It was an island that was only accessible by plane, so she probably shook her head and told him that she didn’t want to leave her friends.
“Your father was too skilled and had too many followers to just quit. The boss of Serim back then wouldn’t have let your father go too easily. And Kang SungHo was there to witness it all. He probably felt jealous and a sense of defeat at the time.”
EunHa’s eyes began to water. She kept her eyes wide open to hold back the tears as she let out huff of laughter.
“I guess being too talented can be a problem. In the end, he was stabbed to death by a fellow member of the same organization.”
KyungHyun looked at her as she scoffed. He caught her eyes and began to speak slowly but with conviction.
“Your father only thought about his family until his dying breath. That much is definitely true.”
“…But he was still just a gangster in the end.”

“Just because they’re in the mob doesn’t mean that they don’t hold anything dear to their hearts. For your father, it was his family.”
EunHa felt herself choke up. Her eyes began to redden as she looked up at him with a silent smile. KyungHyun lightly swept his hand across her face as she tried to hold back her tears. He softly pressed his lips against hers. When he tried to thrust his tongue inside, EunHa pushed him away and asked him a question.
“…What is it for you?”



“What do you mean?”

KyungHyun brought her finger to his lips and lightly bit it. Even thought it was covered in soap bubbles, he didn’t care. He pulled her to his chest, disturbing the water that filled the tub.
“What’s dear to your heart?” “That? I can’t think of anything.”
“Then why are you doing something so dangerous like this?”
“After I became a policeman, this was my first assignment.”
It was such an expected answer from him that it was almost disappointing.
“…Do you have any family?” “I do.”
At his curt reply, EunHa looked up at him with confusion.

“Do your parents know you’re doing this kind of work?”

KyungHyun pressed her fingers to his lips as he smiled faintly. Did he have a complicated home life that forced him to join the police force? Was he working because he needed the money? EunHa did a double take. She suddenly didn’t want to hear his melodramatic life story.
“My father has probably received a report from someone about my situation by now.”
“…What do you mean?”

“My father used to be the previous police commissioner.



Even though it’s been a while since he’s retired, he still has some pull around here.”
EunHa blinked. KyungHyun wiped a drop of water running down her face and spoke calmly.
“You seem surprised.”
“…I’m as shocked as I was when I first heard you were police.”
“Is this something to be so shocked about?”

His wet hair was swept back, revealing his forehead. Even though he was completely nude, he still looked neat and impeccable.
“I never expected you to be born with a golden spoon.” “I remember our household to be pretty average.”
Yeah, right. EunHa looked at him with disbelief as KyungHyun murmured.
“The title seems pretty lofty, but the salary wasn’t as big as you’d think.”
“Okay. We’ll just say you were born with a silver spoon instead of a gold one. Even if your father was dedicated to his job, wasn’t he reluctant to let his son join such a dangerous mission?”
Seeing all the members of the National Assembly fret about not being able to expedite their children’s mandatory military service on the news, EunHa couldn’t understand KyungHyun’s father.
“In my household, there are three sons. Because our house is filled with men, everyone’s pretty indifferent about each other.”



“…Fine, let’s leave your father for now. What about your mother?”
“My mother passed away when I was seven.”

When he replied indifferently, EunHa asked another question.

“What do you brothers do?”

“My older brother is a human rights lawyer. My younger brother is a war correspondent photographer, so we don’t know where he is exactly at the moment.”
EunHa stared at him in silence. She tried to imagine the life of Shin KyungHyun. A sigh left her lips.
“That’s seriously so crazy.” “What is?”
“His son might die any minute, but the police commissioner father is completely fine with that. I can’t understand it.”
“Because a parent can’t live their children’s lives for them.”
KyungHyun smiled faintly. Even since he was little, every member of his family did everything on their own. Their taciturn personalities and lack of emotion was probably genetic. His father didn’t concern himself with the lives of his three sons.
“My brothers knew what they wanted to do at a young age, but nothing seemed to interest me.”
“Then did you choose to join the police force because of your father?”
“I guess you can say that. Even after graduating high school, there wasn’t anything I wanted to do. There wasn’t



anything I wanted to study in college either, but… I thought that if I became a policeman like my father, it would give me more of a thrill.”
“…Thrill?”

EunHa frowned.

“Yeah. I felt that my life was pretty boring when I was young. I guess another way of putting it is that I didn’t feel a sense of accomplishment. Even though there was no one there to praise me, when I did get any praise, it didn’t particularly like it or anything. Everything seemed useless… Now that I think about it, I might have been emotionally dense.”
“Excuse me. Did… anyone ever say that you were cold as a child?”
“…From time to time.”

“Or that you were full of yourself? Or rude little bastard?” “……”
Judging from his blank expression and the fact that he wasn’t denying it, he had definitely heard it before. Of course. EunHa scoffed as she continued speaking.
“I got goosebumps when you told me they called you a member of the elite, but I think this is a bit more believable.”
“What is?”

“The rude, arrogant, twenty-year-old Shin KyungHyun. I imagine you were a lot worse when you were younger.”
KyungHyun chuckled, but he didn’t say anything.



“Anyways, you ended up living a life full of thrill just like you wanted.”
“You’re right. Seeing people die in front of my eyes and having my life constantly in danger, I don’t have time to be bored. I thought I was getting on a thrilling rollercoaster, but it turned out to be a train to hell instead. And I couldn’t get out.”
She couldn’t tell what he was thinking about from his languid voice.
“I felt that there was no other choice but for me to survive, so I did my best. But sometimes I got confused on whether I was actually a thug or police.”
Having lived undercover for so long, it was understandable that he experienced an identity crisis. His large hand softly rubbed her shoulder. The temperature of the bath had gone down a bit, but her body was still warm. EunHa stared at him as she opened her mouth.
“So did you make an effort to remind yourself that you were police every day?”
“…Is there something you want to say?”

KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed. EunHa grabbed his hand as he began to slide it into her cleavage.
“Your room doesn’t have any curtains. If someone told me it was a prison cell, I’d believe them. And yet you lived there without buying any furniture for many years. Was it because you were trying to remind yourself that you weren’t the director of KeumOh but a policeman of South Korea?”
“…Are you interrogating me right now?”

KyungHyun’s brows furrowed as he smiled.



“I’m just telling you what I think. It didn’t seem like you were enjoying your reality.”
EunHa hesitated before continuing.
“…It seemed like you were afraid you’d enjoy it.”

She thought she felt KyungHyun’s pulse race through his hand. His hand tensed up.
“It’s true that I was nervous I’d end up a thug to the bone at the rate I was going.”
To hear this cold-blooded man admit that he was nervous sounded strange.
“At first, I consciously made an effort. How would a gangster talk? How would he act? Every moment, every second, I thought before I acted. Because I didn’t want anyone to suspect that I was a cop. So that they wouldn’t even question what I was doing there.”
“…Because if you didn’t, you wouldn’t survive.”

EunHa murmured as if she was talking to herself. She thought about the term ‘effort’. How much effort did he put in so that he wouldn’t get caught in this game of life and death?
“It wasn’t too bad when my efforts became a habit… But before I realized it, when I looked in the mirror, I saw a gangster drenched in blood staring back at me. From that point on, I began to feel afraid. Afraid that I’d disappear at any moment.”
EunHa asked in a soft voice.

“How did you overcome those moments?”



“I ran until I couldn’t run anymore. It reminded me of the times when I was being trained in the academy, and it made me feel better. It also got rid of any trivial thoughts.”
EunHa recalled how he had kept the ball in play for 40 minutes at the squash courts and chuckled.
“Then why did you act like a sexually deprived gangster when I met you at the squash courts?”
“That was the truth.” “…What was?”
“I think you know better than anyone the sexual attraction I felt for you.”
EunHa didn’t bother denying it and blurted out her reply.

“You’re right. I thought you were full of yourself, telling me that I wasn’t your type when your lower half was standing up like that.”
KyungHyun’s lips stretched into his characteristic languid smile as he stretched out his hand and slipped his fingers between the cheeks of her bottom. He began to rub her soft spot, causing the water in the tub to ripple. The sound of the bathwater crashing against the bathtub walls echoed in the room.
“I didn’t want to fall for a young woman and make a fool of myself. I didn’t have time for that.”
“Then are you here with me because you suddenly have the time now?”
“I can’t help it anymore. Whenever I’m with you, I go crazy because I want to have sex. Even though we do it multiple times a day, I’m always hard.”



“Don’t you feel embarrassed when those words leave your mouth?”
“Not really. It’s the truth.”

As he continued to rub the place he had countlessly licked and penetrated, he felt the blood rush through his body.
“I’m not only fond of your face. Everything about you is my type. You’re smart, incredibly observant, and have good intuition for a kid.”
“Does it make you feel better when you stress my age and emphasize how you’re older than me?”
“You’re my guilty pleasure.”

KyungHyun softly whispered. He brought his face close to hers and flashed his milky teeth as he smiled. His sexy smile caused the area between her legs to grow wet.
The normally cold, expressionless face was now flashing her a languid smile.
EunHa felt that this was probably Shin KyungHyun’s true face. She had never met this person before, and she would probaby never meet him again.
If KyungHyun hadn’t gone undercover in the criminal organizations, their paths would never have crossed like this. If that were the case, how would she have felt about him?
“Even if you’re my type, I didn’t plan on embracing such a rookie like you.”
Whatever the case, she probably wouldn’t have felt such an intense attraction to him as she did now.



“How is a twenty-six-year-old a rookie?” “That’s the way it is for me.”
She turned her head in disbelief. KyungHyun looked at her profile and wrapped his hand around her cheek.
“And if that woman approached me to kill me, shouldn’t I have been more wary with her?”
As he licked her lips, she could feel his arousal. His wet face was stuck to hers.
“Losing my mind and having sex with a woman in the middle of my assignment should have been impossible for me…”
He lightly bit her lower lip.

“Whenever I’m with you, all the rules I’ve kept seem to collapse.”
He had told her that he had been afraid of losing who he was while he lived as a gangster of a criminal organization. EunHa felt that it was an unnecessary worry.
“…So is that why you’re so turned on?”

For an adrenaline junkie, the danger he made of his own doing would probably bring him the most thrill. The languidly smiling man in front of her was someone who would never kill himself. His ego was too great for that to happen.
“How’d you know?”

EunHa met KyungHyun’s gaze and let out an exasperated sigh.

“I’ve been thinking this for a while now, but do you know that you have an incredibly perverted personality?”



“I agree.”

He bumped his sculpted nose to hers as he faintly smiled. When she felt his finger penetrate her wet entrance, she quickly tried to push his hand away with all her might.
“Enough. If we do it again today, I think I’m going to faint.”

EunHa lifted her head and complained as she glared at him reproachfully.
“Isn’t it ungentlemanly to rile up a woman and just leave her like this?”
“It’s fine…”

“I won’t drag it out.”

Instead of replying, EunHa glared at him. KyungHyun took his hand away from between her thighs and clicked his tongue in disappointment.
“You have so little stamina for such a young kid.” “Excuse me, just taking you as much as I have is…!”
He suddenly picked her up and lifted her from the water. She had told him multiple times not to carry her like this, but KyungHyun continued to carry her around like a parcel. KyungHyun whipped a towel off the rack and wrapped her dripping body in one swoop. After drying off most of the water, he laid her down on the bed.
Because it was the middle of summer, the sun was still up in the evening sky. Even though the strong rays shone into the room, EunHa had been locked up in here for almost a month now. She couldn’t tell the change in season happening outside.
Having left the warm waters of the bath and now lying on the cool,



crisp sheets, EunHa enjoyed the pleasant sensation. KyungHyun lied down next to her with his arm underneath his head.
“What about you?” “What?”
“What did you do to endure the hard times?”

The last time KyungHyun had seen her was 10 years ago. Because she had lived under her overprotective parents, her mental age seemed to be younger than her sixteen years.
And that girl had developed into a woman who KyungHyun had almost not recognized. In that long stretch of time, many things would have happened to her. KyungHyun knew that things weren’t always happy for her.
“Unlike other people, I joined the organization at a young age, so it wasn’t that hard for me.”
As KyungHyun watched her calmly reply with a straight face, KyungHyun’s black eyes softened.
“I’m glad.”
“…But there were times I was a bit tired.” “What did you do then?”
“I watched movies.” “Do you like movies?”
“More specifically, I like going to the movie theater. When all the lights go out, my heart races. Because I like it so much.”
“Why do you like it?”



EunHa momentarily stopped speaking when she saw his face filled with confusion.
“…For that short moment, I feel like I’m completely taken out of my reality.”
Her voice slightly lowered as she mumbled distantly.

“What about when the movie ends?”

“It’s like coming back from a short vacation. Back to my real life.”
“If your reality is shitty, you wouldn’t want to come back.”

EunHa rised her voice as she shrugged.

“That’s why I always stay seated until the very end. Even after the credits have finished rolling, I stay in my seat until the lights are completely turned on. Sometimes there’s a scene at the very end too… and it feels like someone left a secret present for those that stayed. It feels good. As if I was invited to a special play.”
“……”

“Why are you looking at me like that?”

“I’m trying to imagine how that feels, but I can’t figure it out at all.”
EunHa laughed softly.

“Of course. I don’t think I can imagine you sitting in a movie theater either.”
If it was Shin KyungHyun, he’d be wearing his expensive suits and sit uncomfortably in the seats. He also seemed to be the type of person who would get up as soon as the movie ended, almost as if



he’d been waiting to leave.

“Should we go see a movie together next time?”

At KyungHyun’s question, EunHa looked straight at him and shook her head.
“I don’t want to.” “Why not?”
“I just told you. I’m the last person to leave a theater. I don’t think someone like you can endure the boredom.”
“I’d be looking at you the whole time, so why would I be bored?”
“…You’d look at me in a movie theater instead of watching the movie?”
“Yeah.”

EunHa frowned in disbelief.

“Then why would you even go to a movie theater? It’s dark, so you wouldn’t be able to see very well. You can just look at me as much as you want in a bright place. Here, you can see me now.”
“I want to see what you look like when you’re really happy.”
EunHa had been bringing her face closer to his when she suddenly stopped at his reply. She bit her lips. He brushed her forehead as he continued to speak. She felt her pulse speed up when she felt his large hand softly touch her.
“I’m curious about the way you look when you’re completely drawn to the screen, and I’m also curious about



how you look when you’re disappointed at the end of the movie to the point where you don’t even want to leave your seat.”
“……”

“Up until now, I haven’t even stepped anywhere near a movie theater, but now I feel the sudden urge to go.”
In a dark room where his vision wasn’t perfectly clear, he wouldn’t be able to fend off any surprise attacks, so it was dangerous. No, he couldn’t even imagine doing something for personal pleasure. After getting used to this lifestyle, he had never even felt that kind of desire. KyungHyun brought his face close to hers before pressing a kiss onto her lips.
“You’re like a summer cold.”
“…Are you reciting a poem right now?”

“Are you saying I’m poetic? What an honor.”

“I’m sorry to say this, but I don’t think you have any talent in that field.”
KyungHyun chuckled at her declaration.

“It just means that I never thought I’d catch it. I usually don’t catch colds.”
“……”

“I never thought I’d be defenseless to a woman like you. I never knew that it was possible.”
“Hmm… you don’t come across a woman who looks like me very often, do you?”
“A woman with your personality isn’t common either.”



Being a man who didn’t know how to joke around, he answered her honestly. Uncomfortable with the tickling sensation in her heart, EunHa attempted to frown, but it was in vain.
“The more I get to know you, the more feverish I become.”

His deep gaze sucked her in.

“But I don’t hate it.”
TN: Why do I feel like this is the calm before the storm…? □







His body gradually became warmer. EunHa gave a ‘hmph’ and coughed awkwardly.
“I’m sorry to say this, but… Because you’re keeping me locked up in here, I don’t feel like your words are credible.”
“This is the safest place for you to be.”

KyungHyun got on top of her and pressed his lips behind her ear. She could hear the sound of his wet kisses. Her body trembled automatically as she felt his body heat on her skin. EunHa tried her best to return to her senses as she asked him something she had been wondering about every single day.
“How much longer do I have to stay here like this?” “Just endure it until this is all over.”
His answer was just as she expected. EunHa drew in a breath when KyungHyun grabbed her breast and popped her nipple into his mouth. Knowing him, this would all be over only when the leaders of YongSung and Serim were put in prison.
Because of that one goal, he had hidden his identity for such an unbelievably long time, working inside this criminal organization as a gangster.
“Until I return to my rightful spot, all you have to do is stay here.”



“Won’t it take a long time?”

KyungHyun sucked her breast even harder. EunHa recalled her first day of work when she was called into his office. He told her to be prepared to be locked up for 24 hours a day if she ever became his woman. She thought it was an empty threat, but she was wrong.
When he believed himself to be right, he was not willing to budge. He had told her the truth, which had stemmed from his dogmatic and stubborn personality. She began to realize with more clarity that Shin KyungHyun had the ability to keep her locked up in here the whole time.
EunHa’s sigh gradually turned into a breathless moan. After leaving countless love bites on her body, KyungHyun pushed himself up and covered her body with his.
He dug his fingers into her hair and began to kiss her as she stared at him with distant eyes. EunHa felt that it was time to make a decision.
Honestly, the Shin KyungHyun in front of her was a charming man. That night, as she was running barefoot in the streets after witnessing her parents’ murders, KyungHyun was the one who had saved her. However, it wasn’t enough to make her feel any romantic sentiment towards the man.
He was just a man who closely embodied ‘strength’ in EunHa’s mind. A man overflowing with testosterone. As she spent more time with this charming and strong man, it was only natural that she was being drawn to him.
EunHa wasn’t going to deny these feelings, and she didn’t feel the need to. This man always flipped her expectations upside-down, and she wanted to know more about him.
It was also true that she felt excited knowing that KyungHyun knew



her history and her identity. The sixteen-year-old EunHa who had been trembling in fear wasn’t completely dead.
When he had told her that he had persistently given his all to survive up to this point, she never expected to be caught up in the strange emotions that overcame her.
This policeman told her that he had done everything he possibly could to survive. He honestly told her of the times he felt tired and nervous. While it felt awkward and fascinating to listen to, she also felt that this side of him suited him pretty well.
Until now, EunHa had constantly hid her weaknesses from others. She felt that it was the right thing to do if she wanted to survive. She didn’t have the courage to honestly reveal her past and show others her weaknesses.
Would there ever be a day when she could be frank with somebody and talk about the old days with them? When all her revenge had been fulfilled and she revealed everything about her bloodcurdling past, was there a man in this world who had enough guts to say ‘Ah, really?’ as he sat by her side and listened to her…
“What are you thinking about?” “I’m thinking about a guy.”
KyungHyun stopped in the middle of a deep kiss and sighed. His lips began to form a smile, but his fierce glare said otherwise. Possessiveness and jealousy spread across his sculpted face.
“Will you tell me his name?”

His easygoing and languid voice reached her ears.

“Why?”

“So that I can shoot him down.”



EunHa let out a groan as she laughed before hooking her arms around his neck. She reached up and gave him a wet kiss. The veins in KyungHyun’s neck bulged at her small action.
“Just embrace me for now.”

“Didn’t you say that you’d faint if we had sex one more time?”
“It’s fine if you don’t want to.”

At EunHa’s whisper, KyungHyun lost the last of his composure. His sturdy knee opened her thighs.
“You say that because you know it drives me crazy, right?” “Hng… I don’t…know. Does it really?”
His erect penis slid into her. Now familiar with this sensation, EunHa’s body automatically sucked him in. He pierced her deeply as his thighs tensed.
“I get even more aroused whenever you push me away.” “I know.”
“You know?”

“Yes. Everyone’s the same. You’re not the only one who’s like that.”
EunHa wrapped her legs around him and whispered in a tempting voice. KyungHyun scoffed bitterly.
“I believe I already told you that it’s taboo to compare me to other punks.”
“Then make it so that I can’t compare you to them.”



Whenever she was with KyungHyun, EunHa felt as if she were playing a dangerous game. Her opponent had a strong hand, so she tried to bluff her way out. However, he didn’t even understand what a bluff was. On top of his constant poker face, he had the confidence of a man who was always willing to go all-in.
“Don’t regret those words.”

A strong man was breathtakingly splendid, and EunHa’s eyes were caught by the splendidness. Suddenly, his thrusts became fiercer. Covered by his sturdy body, EunHa moaned as a thought popped into her head. No one else could kill Kang SungHo for her.
For the past 10 years, there had been times when things got so difficult that all she wanted to do was curl up and cry. However, she had never thought of ending her own life. Just for revenge, EunHa felt that she needed to live on. She could tell herself that her life had worth. And because of that, she was able to laugh.
“Don’t think about anything else while I’m holding you.”

Shin KyungHyun was a very observant man. He was as possessive as she expected him to be, but he drew her to him more than she thought.
“Don’t… let me treat you harshly. Don’t let me break you.”

His warm, large hand caressed her small face. Pinned underneath his body, EunHa gave him a faint smile.
“I’m not a woman who will break just because someone mistreats me.”
KyungHyun silently looked at her for a moment before letting out a hot breath. Even though he didn’t say anything, his eyes were filled with countless, dizzying thoughts. Her cheek began to shake slightly. EunHa reached up and covered his beautiful, long hand as it trembled on her cheek. Then she softly whispered to him.



“I thought you already knew that.”

Black fireworks went off in his eyes. He began to sprinkle hot kisses over her cheeks and lips. As he began to pound into her harder and harder, EunHa felt her body move up the mattress.
“What…should I do with you?”

Just as EunHa was about to hit the bedpost, KyungHyun wrapped her head with his hand and placed a kiss onto her hair. At his rhetorical question, EunHa chuckled.
“Do you, hnng… Do you like me that much? To the point of ruining me?”
“Don’t joke around.”

“Your arrogant, blank face is quite handsome, but as expected… You look the sexiest when you lose your mind like a beast in bed. I think the gap between those two faces excites me. Maybe that’s why I like having sex with you so much.”
“Fuck…”

A curse hissed through his teeth. The only time KyungHyun let out a strong curse like that was when he was losing control. His ears began to redden.
EunHa raised both arms and tightly wrapped them around his back as she pulled him towards her. Every time his cock penetrated her drenched entrance, wet sounds endlessly echoed in the room. Her circulation sped up as the dizzying pleasure zinged through her body. Although her whole body was damp, her lips were dry. As her tongue stuck to the roof of her mouth, EunHa felt a surge of thirst.
This was the first time she felt such a strong attraction for someone. This ‘romantic feeling’ he indifferently blurt out was



something she never experienced, and she never wanted to.

With other men, she felt excited whenever she was the dominant one. However, that feeling didn’t last very long. But with KyungHyun, it was different. She was drawn to his strength. If she did as he said and obediently stayed hidden as she waited, Shin KyungHyun was a man who could possibly bring her whatever she wanted.
However, she wouldn’t be satisfied with just that. She didn’t want to be spoon-fed. Having lived her whole life for the sake of revenge, she needed to be the one who stamped the period at the end of her revenge story. That was the only way she’d find a purpose in this life she’d run with gritted teeth.
“I told you not to think about anything else. You must really… want to get disciplined by me.”
KyungHyun spoke in a hoarse voice as he panted for breath. As she gazed into his lustful eyes, EunHa whispered dazedly.
“…You won’t even discipline me properly.”

“You don’t think I can? Now that I’ve fallen for you, you must see me as a retarded blockhead.”
“Try it then. Let’s see what you… Aagh!”

KyungHyun bit down painfully on her neck and sucked. It was enough to bring out a cry from her. EunHa frowned as she laughed. She never liked besotted men because they seemed mentally weak, but it ironically felt good whenever KyungHyun held her so tightly that she felt like her bones would shatter.
It wasn’t too difficult to find the reason why. It was because she was drawn to him. As EunHa’s entrance squeezed his cock, KyungHyun’s body shivered.
“Ugh, good… Good…!”



At he blurted out his honest appreciation, he drew in a shaky breath and began to place damp kisses on her neck and shoulders. As he sucked her skin, his cock began to pump harder as the rhythm sped up. EunHa felt her body melt once again.
“Hng, hnng, aaagh, ugh, aaah…!”

No matter how many times she went through it, she never got used to this feeling. The intense pleasure caused her body to shake. She pondered about it one more time. In order to seriously consider her relationship with Shin KyungHyun, she needed to put an end to the past.
EunHa raised her head when she heard the bedroom door open. The person who entered was a woman EunHa had seen once before. Lieutenant Han.
“How do you feel?”

“I feel a lot better now.”

Unlike the call girl outfit she had been wearing before, Lieutenant Han was now wearing simple pants and a suit jacket. The name of the hotel was monogrammed on her left chest.
Her hair was fixed into a twisted bun and she was wearing horn- rimmed glasses. She looked completely different from when EunHa had first met her. While Lieutenant Han seemed to suit this style, EunHa felt that Lieutenant Han’s personal style was probably closer to this disguise than the last one.
“I’ll be in the living room, so please call me if you need anything.”
“You’re Lieutenant Han, right?” “Yes.”



Lieutenant Han slightly raised her horn-rimmed glasses with her finger. It was a small and modest movement.
“Can you talk with me for a little bit?”

At EunHa’s request, Lieutenant Han slowly walked over to the table and sat down on the backless chair. She gazed at EunHa as if inviting her to say what she had in mind. EunHa looked back at her and waved her hand. The handcuffs on her wrist rattled.
“As you can see, I’m currently being held in custody like this. When the person who did this to me is out, I have no one to talk to. It’s incredibly difficult to stay inside this room all day with nothing to do.”
“…Superintendent Shin is worried about you, Lee EunHa- ssi.”
Her curt, businesslike reply was acknowledging that it was frustrating for EunHa, but that it was the only way to keep her safe.
“Even if that’s the case, this isn’t the way to do it. I feel like I’d rather be locked up in a jail cell instead.”
“There’s nothing I can do about my superior’s decisions.”

EunHa let out a short sigh. Then she lifted her head and looked at Lieutenant Han.
“Lieutenant-nim, can you come a little closer? It’s already depressing being locked up like this, but when you’re putting so much distance between us, I feel like I have an infectious disease.”
Lieutenant Han hesitate for a moment before she eventually got up and walked to EunHa’s side. KyungHyun was a sunbae who was many ranks above her. Even though she respected his decisions, KyungHyun had been inside the criminal organization for a long time



now. He had developed a strange side to him.

Even if it was for her safety, to think that he had handcuffed this woman inside this room for almost a month. But it wasn’t like the person receiving this treatment was taking it obediently either. Lieutenant Han dragged the chair to EunHa’s bedside and sat down.
“Now, what would you like to talk about?”

“If I ask you a question, can you give me an answer?” “I’ll do what I can.”
“How much longer will I be trapped in here?”

“I don’t think I can give you a definite answer. That’s something for Superintendent Shin to decide.”
EunHa nodded at the obvious answer before asking another question.
“According to him, he told me he’d let me go once everything was over. Do you know when it’ll be over? Don’t you know what he’s thinking since you’re both in the same team?”
“If everything was going according to plan, the d-day would have been in half a month.”
Even though she had said this calmly and politely, her words were laced with thorns. EunHa blinked at her. Lieutenant Han then continued speaking with a blank expression.
“If the leaders of YongSung and Serim had gathered at Shenzhen, we would have been able to arrest everyone.”
EunHa counted the days in her head. She then realized that KyungHyun’s planned business trip to China was coming closer. Even



though she had been locked up, the days seemed to pass by surprisingly faster than she thought.
“That is… if Lee EunHa-ssi didn’t shoot Noh HyungChul at the founding party.”
EunHa looked into the sharp eyes behind the glasses and changed her mind about trying to gain Lieutenant Han’s sympathy. This woman showed no crack in her armor, which seemed to be a characteristic of anyone who worked with KyungHyun. EunHa decided it would be better to try and break her facade instead.
“I didn’t say this to blame you, Lee EunHa-ssi. I just answered the question you asked me. I apologize if I hurt your feelings.”
Lieutenant Han took EunHa’s silence as a sign of disappointment.
EunHa quickly shook her head.

“No, you didn’t hurt my feelings.” “I’m glad.”
“You’re right. I was the one who acted unpredictably and ruined your plan. I apologize for making your situation more difficult. You all probably prepared for this for a long time.”
There was no criticism or condescension in EunHa’s voice.
Lieutenant Han’s voice became a bit softer.

“I’m glad you understand.” “There’s one other thing.” “Yes, please say it.”
“Why don’t I fix the plan that I’ve ruined?”

Lieutenant Han’s neat eyebrow rose up. She blinked as she waited



for EunHa to continue, so EunHa opened her mouth and spoke earnestly.
“I still remember what you said that time.” “What did I say?”
“That you planned to use me to leak the information about the drugs to Kang SungHo. You said that it was your original plan.”
“That was our original plan.”

She tried to hide it, but Lieutenant Han’s stiff tone was laced with disappointment.
“I can still do it.”

At EunHa’s careful words, Lieutenant Han tilted her head in confusion.
“Lieutenant Han, try and persuade Shin KyungHyun to send me back to Kang SungHo.”
“…I’ve already suggested it to Superintendent Shin already.”
EunHa frowned when she heard Lieutenant Han’s reply.

“And?”

“He told me he’d find another way.” “Why?”
Lieutenant Han looked at EunHa as if to say the reason was obvious. She then answered her in a dry tone.
“Superintendent Shin is worried you’ll be put in danger. In



this current situation, you will be in danger if you return to Serim. That’s the truth.”
EunHa silently drew in a deep breath. Her eyes reddened as she looked at Lieutenant Han.
“…Kang SungHo can’t kill me easily.”

“That’s what you think, EunHa-ssi. The rest of us don’t feel the same way.”
“For the past 10 years, I’ve been by that man’s side. I know better. That man won’t be able to kill me easily.”
“How can you be so sure, Lee EunHa-ssi?”
“Between Kang SungHo and me… We have a long history together.”
Lieutenant Han looked at EunHa in silence before opening her mouth with much difficulty.
“…Even if Kang SungHo and Lee EunHa-ssi have a close relationship, it’s still too dangerous right now.”
EunHa’s eyes darkened at Lieutenant Han’s reply. Lieutenant Han spoke very directly and didn’t beat around the bush. EunHa didn’t hate it, but she could tell what she was thinking. Once she realized this, a chill ran down her forearm underneath the patient gown. EunHa cleared her throat with much difficulty.
“If I were lovers with Kang SungHo, you may be right. However, that man and I have a way more complicated history together.”
“What do you mean by that?”

Lieutenant Han glanced at EunHa with suspicious eyes and asked.



EunHa looked like she had just spit out some bitter medicine as she answered back.
“Kang SungHo… is a crazy bastard who gets his rocks off by seeing me crawl on the ﬂoor for him.”
After finding out the truth about her parents’ murder, EunHa finally understood SungHo’s behavior. He had murdered the rival he had been unable to beat, and now his dead rival’s daughter had pledged her allegiance to him. How laughable and satisfying was this situation for him?
She finally realized why he had never completely devoured her. No, it wasn’t that he didn’t do it. I was that he couldn’t. Because her face looked just like her father’s, he felt too uncomfortable sleeping with her. What SungHo wanted from her was complete obedience. He wanted nothing more than to completely dominate her.
EunHa felt as if her throat was closing up. She swallowed, but her mouth was dry.
“I know what excites that man. Therefore, there’s no need to worry for my safety.”
“All right. Let’s say that Kang SungHo keeps you alive.
Then what about Lee EunHa-ssi?”

“What do you mean?’

EunHa frowned, unable to understand Lieutenant Han’s question.

“We don’t want to put you in a position where you will attack Kang SungHo without a care for your own safety. Serim won’t collapse just because Kang SungHo dies. It doesn’t pull them out by the roots. We need to capture Kang SungHo, make him admit to his crimes, and pick off all the other higher-ups within the organization to completely put an end to Serim.”



Thanks to KyungHyun’s efforts, Serim had shrunk in size. However, this criminal organization had a long history, and pulling it out by the roots was going to be a difficult endeavor. As Lieutenant Han explained this to her, EunHa raised her voice as she replied.
“…I’m happy with one failure under my belt. I won’t be charge in recklessly. I’ll help you guys capture Kang SungHo.”
“Why?”

Lieutenant Han looked at EunHa and asked calmly. If she wasn’t sure of her motives, she wouldn’t be able to trust her.
“Why are you willing to put yourself in danger to help us, Lee EunHa-ssi?”
“That’s…”

“Lee EunHa-ssi.”

Lieutenant Han watched as EunHa chewed her lips in frustration.
Then she calmly opened her mouth and continued.

“We have been preparing a long time for this. We are as capable as you when it comes to capturing both Kang SungHo and Noh HyungChul. Also…”
Lieutenant Han hesitated for a moment.

“More than anyone, Superintendent Shin wants to quickly finish this so that he can return to his rightful place. I believe you can guess why he’s so anxious, Lee EunHa-ssi.”
“……”

“This morning, Superintendent Shin notified Kang SungHo of your death.”



EunHa’s eyes twisted and trembled silently.

“Even though Kang SungHo told us that you were a member of Serim, we disregarded that and even rejected his order to return you to him. And now that we’ve told him of your death, we have basically declared war on Kang SungHo.”
“…I’m not so stupid as to not understand what that means.”
EunHa’s voice had slightly softened, but her eyes on Lieutenant Han became more intense.
“Then let me ask you one more question.”

EunHa asked with a shaky voice, and Lieutenant Han nodded.

“Go ahead.”

“Do you believe Superintendent Shin’s decision is the best decision he could have made?”
At EunHa’s sudden question, Lieutenant Han remained silent. After a moment, she answered back in a steady voice.
“Our jobs require us to trust in the decisions made by our superiors and do our best to make it happen together.”
“How can you trust someone just because they’re your superior?”
“Superintendent Shin is someone with a lot of talent. The basis of my trust lies in my experience with him until now.”
“But statistics aren’t always correct.”

“The 12 years of proof that Superintendent Shin has shown us is too difficult to ignore.”



EunHa couldn’t refute anything Lieutenant Han said. She frowned and let out a sigh.
“Now can I ask you a question, Lee EunHa-ssi?”

EunHa looked up at Lieutenant Han in surprise. Lieutenant Han didn’t wait for her answer and continued on with her question.
“Your life has been saved twice thanks to Superintendent Shin, Lee EunHa-ssi. Both times, Superintendent Shin risked blowing his cover and saved you from the clutches of the criminal organization.”
“…So?”

“Why is it that you can’t trust Superintendent Shin?”

EunHa looked at her for a moment before flashing her teeth in a smile.
“It’s not about whether I trust him or not.”

EunHa spoke in a clear voice.

“I just feel more comfortable doing things on my own.”

She was saying that she trusted in herself more than she trusted others. Even though it could have sounded arrogant, EunHa shrugged her shoulders and didn’t seem to be saying this from a place of overconfidence.
“I’m grateful that he saved my life, but I don’t think that gives him a right to grab and shake my life as he wishes.”
Lieutenant Han’s lips went up slightly. Seeing this, EunHa felt that she was in agreement and raised her brow.
“Don’t you think?”



She was right. Lieutenant Han nodded her head.

“Yes. I understand what you’re saying, Lee EunHa-ssi. However, I don’t think I’ll be of much help to you, so I apologize.”
“That’s okay. I already knew it was going to be difficult to persuade you anyways. Smart and beautiful women tend to be stubborn.”
“……”

“I’m like that, you see.”

Lieutenant Han watched as EunHa winked at her. She felt like she could vaguely understand why KyungHyun was so drawn to her. There was something unique about Lee EunHa. Although she was quite strong for her age and could appeal to one’s sympathy with her acting, she was not the type to drown in self-pity.
“Thank you for understanding.”

“No, thank you for chatting with me.”

“If our chat is finished, I’ll be outside. Please call me if you need anything.”
“Alright, I’ll do that.”

Just as Lieutenant Han got up from her seat, EunHa suddenly spoke up as if she just thought of something. Something had caught her eye for a while now.
“Lieutenant Han, do you have a dog?” “…Why do you ask?”
“I think something’s in your hair.”



There was no way that was possible. Lieutenant Han touched her perfectly coifed hair with a frown. EunHa naturally raised her hand and brushed her hair with her fingers.
“Not there, over here. Wait…Ah!”

Feeling a tug on her hair, Lieutenant Han reflexively snatched EunHa’s hand. When she saw a long, white hair in EunHa’s hand, she relaxed.
“Ah, sorry.”

“That’s okay. I overstepped because I could tell you had a tidy personality. What breed is your dog?”
Seeing that EunHa wasn’t displeased as she asked her question, Leiutenant Han awkwardly answered.
“A samoyed. I like everything about them, but they shed quite a lot. You’ve got a good eye, Lee EunHa-ssi.”
“We used to have a dog a long time ago.” “Ah, really?”
“Yes. But it died by Kang SungHo’s hands.” “……”
“After that, whenever I see dogs, they’re so cute to look at, but they only serve to remind me of our Fluffy, so…”
EunHa’s sentence trailed off. Lieutenant Han raised her glasses and coughed softly.
“…I’m sorry.”

She said this honestly. EunHa shrugged and gave her a faint smile.



“It’s all in the past. I’m sure he’s crossed the rainbow bridge by now and is playing with all the other dogs.”
“Yes.”

“I hope we can meet somewhere else next time. I’d like to hear stories about your dog, Lieutenant Han.”
“…Let’s do that.”

EunHa nodded as Lieutenant Han left the room and disappeared. Click.
The bedroom door closed shut, and EunHa could hear another door close outside. EunHa didn’t move for a long time. Suddenly, she slowly unclenched her fist. A bobby pin that had secured Lieutenant Han’s hair in place fell from between EunHa’s index and middle finger into her palm.
Thanks, Fluffy.

EunHa muttered softly as she leaned back onto the bedpost.
TN: Sorry for the wait! This update was particularly long and wordy. I’ll try to split up the updates a bit better so that I can release more often □…






KyungHyun entered the hotel room and stopped in his tracks. His sharp eyes looked around the room, but it was deserted and bleak. Just as it had been when he left it in the morning.
“……”

He loosened the tie that seemed to be choking his neck. He took off his jacket and undid the cuﬄinks on his wrists. The splatters of blood were vivid against his white shirt. It must have happened when he fought off the surprise attack in the elevator just now.
His opponent was definitely a henchman sent by SungHo. Even though he was disguised as a hotel guest, this man couldn’t hide the sense of danger that was exuding out of him due to his many years of being a gangster.
As this man charged at him from behind to stab him with a knife, KyungHyun kicked him down right away. Inside this narrow elevator, he had to conduct hand-to-hand combat. When the elevator door opened in the middle of this, a normal guest caught a glimpse of the bloody man and screamed, so KyungHyun had to stop.
He left it to the hotel manager to call the police and settle this matter before heading up to his room. Thanks to Lieutenant Han, who had alerted the police beforehand, KyungHyun didn’t have to be called in to fill out the tiring report.
“Whew…”

KyungHyun angrily swept his hand through his hair. It was difficult for someone to attack him in the hotel because it was crawling with YongSung’s men.



However, SungHo had sent an expert assassin anyway. The reason was simple. Realizing that KyungHyun never left the hotel, SungHo believed that Lee EunHa was there as well. Only half a day had passed since KyungHyun had reported her death to him in the morning. However, SungHo was already on the move.
‘…Is it because he doesn’t believe me?’

KyungHyun walked into the kitchen as he recalled the way SungHo had screamed curses at him through the phone. He poured himself a glass of water and gulped it down. Something felt strange since a while ago. After slowly emptying the glass, KyungHyun slowly walked around the spacious living room. He didn’t see any hidden intruders.
Holding the empty glass, KyungHyun sharply glanced at the closed bedroom door. Because of the sudden appearance of an unwelcome guest, KyungHyun’s body was still tense even though the scuﬄe had ended. He didn’t like that. He placed the glass cup on the marble island counter and walked towards the bedroom EunHa was staying in.
He felt that once he saw her safe and sound inside the room, he’d feel better. Once he opened the door, he finally realized the cause of this strange feeling.
“You’re back?”

Unlike him, Eunha looked relaxed as she sat inside the room.
However, she wasn’t sitting on top of the bed.

“Lieutenant Han left urgently, so I thought something happened. You’re back earlier than I expected.”
Perched on the table, EunHa pressed a long cigarette down onto the ashtray as she grinned at him. KyungHyun frowned and took a step towards her. Suddenly, EunHa picked up the handgun on the table and held it up. It was the handgun he kept in the safe.



“If you come any closer, I’ll shoot.”

Her lips stretched into a smile. KyungHyun’s heart raced inside his chest and the blood rushed to his temples.
“Do whatever you want.”

KyungHyun didn’t stop and continued to take slow steps towards her. His dark eyebrows furrowed as his cold face twisted into a frown. He didn’t even want to know how she had gotten out of her handcuffs. How she had managed to get his handgun out of his safe wasn’t important either.
“I’m not going to shoot you. I’m going to shoot myself.”

KyungHyun stopped in his tracks as EunHa raised the muzzle of the gun so that it pressed underneath her chin. She gave him an innocent smile.
“If I shoot from this distance, I’ll probably blow my head off, right?”
“…Don’t do anything dangerous.”

KyungHyun’s face twisted horribly as he spoke in a soft voice. His head throbbed and he felt like he was going to vomit. His mouth was completely dry.
“Yeah, I don’t really want to do it either. So if you have any guns on you, place them on the ground now.”
“I don’t have any.” “Take off your jacket.”
KyungHyun didn’t hesitate and did as he was told. After taking off his suit jacket, he raised his hands up above his shoulders and turned around in a circle.



“You really don’t.”

After making sure KyungHyun didn’t have any guns on him, EunHa chuckled.
“If you’re doing this because you feel frustrated from being locked inside, this isn’t a good idea.”
EunHa raised an eyebrow.

“Superintendent Shin, are you very shocked right now?”

KyungHyun frowned. He wanted to get that muzzle away from her chin, but he couldn’t charge at her right now. He was afraid she would accidentally pull the trigger if he tried to take it away by force. His heart raced so hard in his chest to the point of pain. As his mind was in turmoil, EunHa looked at him and spoke up.
“If I truly wanted to escape, I would have gotten out of the handcuffs, grabbed the gun, and escaped before you returned. Don’t you think?”
KyungHyun swallowed, and his Adam’s apple slowly shook. The thoughts in his mind flew around at a dizzying pace. The solution to this problem didn’t come easily to him.
“Then what do you want?”

He needed to think. If her wish wasn’t to leave this place, then what did she want? KyungHyun’s brows furrowed even deeper.
Did she want to kill him?

It was possible that she had come to hate him because he had ignored her pleas to leave and kept her confined in here for nearly a month.
“I want to talk to you.”



Every morning and evening, he held her and gave her pleasure, causing her to moan in a shrill voice. In the end, he’d continue to hold her until she’d meet his eyes and tell him she wanted him in panting breaths. He’d thought that they had bared themselves to each other in the most primitive way, but was it all a lie for Lee EunHa?
“What do you want to talk about?”

KyungHyun scolded himself for thinking about useless things at a time like this. He bit his lower lip. If EunHa laughed at him and called him an incompetent police at this moment, he wouldn’t be able to refute it.
“Why don’t we sit over there?”

EunHa pointed the gun over to the bed. It was about 1 meter away from the table. As KyungHyun moved, he thought about snatching the gun away from her. However, he was too afraid an accident would occur in the process.
It wouldn’t be too difficult to take the gun away from her, but if she got hurt in the process… The moment of opportunity passed by as he hesitated, and KyungHyun sat down on the edge of the bed. The mattress springs let out a soft groan underneath his weight.
“Well done. Thank you.”

EunHa smiled prettily. She spoke to him as if she were complimenting a child. She began to shake her crossed legs.
“Did Lieutenant Han unlock the handcuffs?”

“Of course not. I tried to make her feel bad for me, but it didn’t work at all. As expected of your subordinate.”
He didn’t think Lieutenant Han would have done something like that either.



“Then?”

“That’s a business secret, so I can’t really tell you.”

“Why didn’t you run away as soon as you got out of the handcuffs?”
“Are you being like this because you can’t shake off your cop habits? I’m the one who wanted to talk, so why do I feel like I’m being interrogated right now?”
“It’s because I can’t understand why you’re being like this.”
KyungHyun crouched down and placed his elbows on his lap and licked his dry lips. Acting relaxed, KyungHyun folded his hands together to hide his damp hands. He couldn’t figure out what it was that she wanted.
“Send me back to Kang SungHo.”

As EunHa cut to the chase, KyungHyun looked up at her and frowned.
“…I don’t think you need my permission in a situation like this.”
Just as she said before, if she had wanted to leave and go back to Kang SungHo, she would have escaped the hotel before he’d returned.
“No, I need it.”

“Why?”

“Because when you’re carrying out a plan, you need to communicate with your colleagues.”
KyungHyun’s frown deepened at her unexpected answer.



“Colleagues?” “Yes, colleagues.”
“Why are you saying this?”

“I want to move on with your plan. I’ll pretend I escaped from here and return to Kang SungHo. After telling him about your plans, I’ll draw him out to China. As you know, Serim needs money right now, and… there’s no way Kang SungHo will let an opportunity of this size slip by. He isn’t going to want any room for error, so there’s a high chance he’ll go there personally. Then you can be on site and arrest him. Isn’t that what the police wanted?”
KyungHyun’s eyes pierced into EunHa, unable to understand the gist of what she was saying. EunHa turned over KyungHyun’s gun in her hand as she looked it over. Then she continued to speak.
“No matter how much of a rat bastard Kang SungHo is, Serim and Kang SungHo won’t be able to weasel out of it if he’s caught red-handed in the middle of a black market drug trafficking site. If you’re worried that I’ll go back and kill Kang SungHo, don’t worry. I won’t do that.”
“…So what’s in it for you?”

KyungHyun asked her a question similar to the one asked by Lieutenant Han. At his soft question, EunHa took her eyes off the gun and looked straight at him. There was a strange gleam in her eyes.
“I’d get my revenge. I thought about it, and if I kill him with one stroke of a knife, I’d be relieved, but I’d also be a bit disappointed. Compared to the 10 years that bastard toyed with me, it’s too light of a punishment.”
“…So?”



“I imagined the shocked face he’d make when he realized I stabbed him in the back. Then I came to the conclusion that this route would be much more satisfying. How would Kang SungHo look like when he realized that the little child he thought was in the palm of his hand was the one who turned on him? Just thinking about it makes me giddy. Haha.”
KyungHyun watched her eyes sparkle as she laughed like a lunatic. He wondered whether she was telling the truth or not. He couldn’t tell if she was being honest at all.
“Even if that’s what you want, returning to Kang SungHo in this situation is extremely dangerous.”
“I won’t die.”

EunHa looked him dead in the eyes as she smiled.

“And I’ve decided that there are some things I want to try with a man named Shin KyungHyun in the future, so I refuse to die just yet.”
“…Don’t play with me.”

KyungHyun blurted out bitterly. His eyes trembled imperceptibly.
EunHa had dug into the crack between them without realizing it. “Use me. I’ll help you return to your rightful place.” “Why would you do that?”
“Because I want to.”

A peculiar gleam entered KyungHyun’s eyes as he looked at her with his cold, smooth face. It wasn’t because EunHa was now pointing the gun at him. His head felt stuffy and dizzy. KyungHyun swept his face with his large hand. Covering half his face behind his hand, his black eyes looked up at her.



“You look very confused.” “I am confused.”
“You said you had romantic feelings for me.” “Yeah.”
It was the truth.

“Can’t I feel the same for you?”

That was a lie. But why does my heart waver and my mind turn into a mess at your obvious attempt?
KyungHyun frowned as he reproached himself when EunHa interrupted his thoughts.
“I’m not saying that I’m crazy in love with you or anything.”
Even though it was disappointing to hear, it sounded a lot more credible. KyungHyun gathered his hands as if he were praying and began to press his index fingers together.
“But I do think that I want to have a fresh start with you.”

EunHa looked straight into his eyes. Like a suspicious cat, her eyes had been glancing around the room this whole time, but now they were clearly looking at him.
“I think I want to get to know you better.”

KyungHyun felt that this wasn’t a lie. Feeling a migraine wash over his temples, he grit his teeth.
“But in order to do that, I need to end this ill-fated connection between me and Kang SungHo.”



“Didn’t I tell you I’d make that happen? I never say anything I don’t mean.”
His voice was now so low that it sounded husky.

“Yeah, so there’s no need to walk in circles to get there. There’s already a trap that has been set thanks to all your time and effort.”
As EunHa spoke to him softly, KyungHyun took a deep breath. As his wide shoulders went up and down, his eyes were boiling as if they were on fire.
“I want to see Kang SungHo gnash his teeth from the betrayal. I want him to trust me until the very end. So that when he finally realizes that I’ve stabbed him in the back, he’ll want to kill himself from the shock of it.”
“It’s too dangerous.”

“I’m not as inexperienced as you think. I think it’s time I show you that.”
EunHa held on to the gun as she jumped off the table. Then she slowly began to walk towards him. She placed the muzzle of the gun onto his forehead. KyungHyun stayed absolutely still. He merely pierced her with his characteristic gaze. His symmetrical lips began to move.
“Kang SungHo will kill you as soon as you return. Are you telling me to just sit back and watch that happen?”
“I won’t die that easily.”

With the gun still on his head, EunHa slowly lowered her face to his. Her lips almost touched his.
“Haa… Really…”



Letting out a sigh that almost sounded like a moan, EunHa began to rub him through his pants with her free hand. A muﬄed groan escaped KyungHyun’s lips.
“How can you be aroused in a situation like this?”

EunHa asked as she laughed. She lightly pressed her lips against his. His cock, which had been at half-mast, was now fully erect. KyungHyun remained on the bed and was as still as stone. He didn’t lay a single finger on her.
“Seriously… You’re not a normal man.”

EunHa spread her legs and plopped onto his lap as she faced him. KyungHyun’s muscular body was hard and tense. As the mattress began to sink, KyungHyun raised his knees so that she wouldn’t fall off.
“Do you remember how you put the gun up against my head like this at the KeumOh founding party?”
Along with her whisper, KyungHyun could hear the small sound of her finger tapping against the trigger of the gun. The handgun in her hand was loaded. If she accidentally pulled the trigger, it would blow off his head.
“But you didn’t shoot in the end. I wonder why.”
“…I never intended to shoot you from the beginning.”

He had only meant to scare her, but he never expected her to act out like that.
“So I’m asking you why.” “……”
“Because you had already fallen for me by then.”



EunHa answered for him as the veins in KyungHyun’s neck stood up. Feeling the hardness underneath her, EunHa grinned.
“You’re starting to like me more and more, aren’t you? No matter how many times we have sex, it’s not enough. And you don’t want to let me out of your sight, isn’t that right? If you can be aroused in a situation like this, aren’t you confused about the loose screws inside your head?”
When he didn’t respond and merely frowned at her, EunHa began to rock her hips as if she were on a swing. His racing heart now felt like it was going to explode out of his chest.
He wasn’t sure if he was so aroused because of the thrill of the moment or if it was due to her body rocking on top of him. It might have been both.
“I understand. You’re not the first man to act like this in my life, you see.”
EunHa wrinkled her cat-like eyes at him, and KyungHyun felt hot desire pulse through his blood stream. He finally realized what it was. The reason why his heart raced like crazy in side his chest and why his blood boiled inside his veins was because of this woman in front of him. This suffocating feeling inside his chest was definitely jealousy. He felt like he’d become a childish man who couldn’t stand it when another man was mentioned from her lips.
“…So let me go back.”

KyungHyun raised his chin, and his hard chest rose and fell with every heavy breath he took. He lifted his hand and tightly grabbed her bottom.
“Huh?”

EunHa flinched as she let out a short exclamation. EunHa frowned when she felt his body heat through her clothes.



“I’ll shoot if you move.”

“Then just go ahead and shoot.”

KyungHyun murmured in a husky voice. This kind of behavior from him made her flush. Instead of grabbing her bottom, he could have disarmed her by grabbing her wrist, but KyungHyun didn’t do that. Whether it was because he was completely relaxed or because he was very bold, she didn’t know. However, her breath caught in her throat. His dark eyes bound her to him like rope. EunHa sighed and let out a soft laugh.
“Other than you, I know one more person who becomes incredibly excited in the face of danger.”
“Who is it?” “Kang SungHo.”
His sculpted face frowned terribly. His long eyes gleamed dangerously.
“In your eyes, am I the same as Kang SungHo?” “No, you’re the exact opposite.”
“Then what did you mean by that?”

KyungHyun spit out his question. EunHa felt his heavy breaths puff against her face as he tried to hold back his anger.
“Kang SungHo tried to kill me, and you tried to save me.” “……”
“But how can the two of you be so alike?”

EunHa faintly laughed. Her eyes gleamed like a wild cat that had caught its prey.



“You both started out in opposite places, so isn’t it obvious that I will react to you two differently?”
“…Seriously, what should I do with you?”

KyungHyun mumbled bitterly in a pained voice. EunHa lowered her forehead to his.
“Of course, you look a lot better than him too.” “…Are you joking around with me right now?”
KyungHyun frowned and bit down painfully on her lips. EunHa pitifully brought her hand to her bitten lips.
“I’m serious.”

EunHa lowered her hands after rubbing her lips a few times.

“Here. Will this be proof enough?”

She took his hand off her bottom and placed the gun in his hand.
KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed.

As soon as he gripped the gun, KyungHyun released the magazine and let it fall to the floor. Then the empty gun followed after it. EunHa shook her open hands as she held them up for him to see.
“Now I don’t have anything left. If you want to handcuff me again, do it. Both hands, both feet, it doesn’t matter.”
“……”

“But next time, I won’t give you a farewell.”

KyungHyun wasn’t so naive as to not understand what EunHa was saying.
“This is your only chance to make a decision. I’m telling



you this now.”

KyungHyun’s sharp jaw tensed.
“…Who taught you to threaten a policeman?”

“Whether you’re police or a gangster, it doesn’t matter to me. I’m just giving you a chance to make a choice. Even though you’re a bit arrogant at times, I’d be a bit disappointed if I never saw a man as handsome as you ever again.”
“You’re joking around until the end, aren’t you?”

KyungHyun wrapped his arms around her back and embraced her as he bitterly murmured. EunHa shrugged her shoulders and laughed innocently.
“That’s why you fell so hard for me.”
TN: The end of the fluffy scenes draws near! I’m excited to get on with the plot, but it’s also a bit bittersweet □







A muﬄed groan escaped the seam of KyungHyun’s lips. Suddenly, he quickly lifted her up with his hands. In no time, EunHa found her back against the mattress, caged within his arms. As his arms tensed up, they began to tremble, causing the mattress to vibrate as well. He seemed to be at a loss for what to do next, so EunHa lifted her head. Once, twice… EunHa pressed her lips to his stiff face.
“I won’t die. Such an amazing policeman has my back, so how can I die so easily?”
Chu, chu. EunHa whispered between kisses. When she finally got to his lips, he swallowed hers. EunHa didn’t reject his rough kiss. Instead, she reciprocated as he began to suck on her tongue and wound her arms tightly around his neck. A warm hand pushed aside her clothes and slipped inside. Just as he had done countless times before, KyungHyun began to sweep his hand along her soft skin.
“I’m going to put a GPS tracker on you… So that I can check your location at any moment.”
As a man who was never willing to compromise, KyungHyun’s declaration was as close to an approval she was going to get. EunHa readily accepted.
“Okay.”

EunHa nodded happily and kissed him again.

“Don’t be so happy when you don’t even know how I feel.
It’s pissing me off.”



“I’ll just think of it as being with Shin KyungHyun for 24 hours a day.”
“I want to embrace you.”

KyungHyun let out a deep breath, his voice hoarse. His eyes were blazing with desire.
“I want you. Right now.” “Same here.”
EunHa slipped two slender hands between the buttons of his shirt and ripped it open.
Clatter.

The buttons on his white dress shirt scattered all over the place as they were ripped off.
“Oh dear. I’m sorry. It looked expensive too.”

Taking off his ruined shirt and tossing it away in one breath, KyungHyun licked his wet lips and narrowed his eyes.
“Of all the things you’ve done today, I liked that the best.” “But I’m just getting started.”
Seeing how KyungHyun was flushed with arousal, EunHa pushed him down and began to kiss his neck and chest.
“Thank you. For going against your stubborn nature.”

When she stamped her lips onto his heaving chest, KyungHyun let out a groan through his teeth.
Just as he was about to flip her over and get on top, KyungHyun froze when EunHa licked the skin underneath his bellybutton.



“Hng…”
EunHa’s face went lower, and she began to unbuckle his belt. As soon as she unzipped the zipper, his straining erection burst out from underneath his underwear. EunHa lowered the band of his underwear, and his swollen penis popped out in front of her face.
“This is really…”

As if boasting of its size, his throbbing penis stood up from the dense thatch of pubic hair right in front of her eyes. EunHa frowned as she smiled.
“Do you know that it’s so big that it’s almost disgusting?” “If you don’t like it, there’s no need to take such a close
look.”

KyungHyun grabbed her shoulders and tried to bring her up. However, she slid his erection right into her mouth. KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed in pleasure as his brows furrowed. Watching his reaction, EunHa slowly raised her head and sucked on the tip. She popped him out of her mouth, making a wet sound. His penis bobbed up and down.
“Did I ever say that I didn’t like it?” “Haa…”
“It’s big and fierce. Just like you. So I actually quite like it.”

She stuck her tongue out. Precum was already seeping out of the tip of his penis. She could smell the thick scent coming from him.
“It tastes weird.”

She slowly slid her tongue over the tip and tasted the evidence of his desire. She mumbled her observation, and KyungHyun’s face



twisted. He slid his hand into her hair as she chuckled.

“I’m at my limit. If you’re going to do it, do it. If not, then come up.”
Holding onto her head, he rubbed his thumb over her eyebrow.
EunHa swallowed him into her mouth once again.
“Ah…”

EunHa heard his ragged breath. She gripped the root of his penis as she began to pump him in and out of her mouth. She felt the ridges of his veins against her tongue. Her cheeks hollowed as she sucked on him, and she could see his abdominal muscles twitch right before her eyes.
“…Enough.”

As she coyly stared up at him, KyungHyun frowned as he felt his climax approach.
“Are you doing this on purpose?”

EunHa took his cock deep into her mouth in response. Even though half of his penis was enough to fill her mouth, she lowered her head and almost took him in to the root. The head of his penis slid down her throat. Her eyes reddened at the discomfort, but she didn’t stop. KyungHyun couldn’t endure it anymore.
“Damn it…”

He grabbed her head and began to lift his hips.
“Hm…! Mmm…! Hmm…!”

KyungHyun pumped his hips as if he were having sex. Even though she felt as if she’d suffocate, EunHa felt herself gradually grow wet. Seeing him so overwhelmed with arousal, EunHa couldn’t help but



get excited herself. Therefore, right before he came, she sucked his penis in to the root one last time.
“Ah…Hng…!”

She felt the warm seed spurt onto the roof of her mouth a few times. EunHa swallowed before getting up and taking off her clothes. KyungHyun watched as he panted for breath. Now completely naked, EunHa climbed on top of him and covered his body with hers. She felt his warm hand on her back. Because no light was turned on, the room was completely dark. However, their eyes were clear and bright. As she felt his chest still heaving with his breaths, EunHa asked him a question.
“Did it feel good?”

“Are you seriously asking me that right now?”

“It was good for me too. Even though the end was so-so.” “Then why did you swallow it?”
EunHa looked at him and licked her lips.

“I thought it would excite you even more.”

“There’s no need to do something like that. Whenever you look at me with those eyes, I instantly get hard.”
“So did you hate it?”

EunHa opened her legs and began to rub herself on his half-stiff penis. His warm hand slid down her back and gripped her bottom.
“Did I hate it?”

She momentarily stopped rocking her body. A moaning laugh burst out of her lips.



“Ha… No way… Hnng…”
“Does this answer your question?”

Even though it hadn’t been that long since he came, his cock had hardened and tensed up as it poked against her. EunHa grabbed his head with both hands.
“How can you react so quickly?” “Isn’t this what you wanted?” “I guess, but… Hnng!”
After rubbing against her slick entrance, his penis found her opening and slid completely inside in one thrust. His cock hardened even more inside her. Feeling him fill her up so completely, EunHa moaned. Hearing her reaction, KyungHyun licked her lips.
It felt as if his cock had also entered her mouth. KyungHyun moved his tongue in and out of her mouth like he was having sex. As his tongue almost reached the back of her throat, a ragged groan escaped his throat. As if she’d forgotten to breathe through her nose, EunHa panted for breath. KyungHyun wrapped the root of her tongue with his and began to suck. Then he licked her wet lips and spoke up in a low voice.
“There’s… one thing you should know…” “What is it?”
“I… don’t usually go easy on anyone.” “So?”
“But I can’t seem to do that with you. I can’t act the way I want to act. It’s driving me crazy.”
He wondered where such a nuisance of a woman had come from.



KyungHyun embraced her and began to fiercely pump his hips into her.
“I locked a woman away by handcuffing her inside, but she escaped anyway. What am I supposed to do to catch a woman like that?”
“…You just have to make it so that the handcuffs aren’t necessary.”
She gazed at him as she gave him her answer. He grabbed her hand. His hand was damp with sweat, but she didn’t take her hand back.
“I know that I’m going to regret my decision, but I don’t know what else to do.”
His stiff rod ground into her drenched entrance. He was so deep inside her that his scrotum pressed against her. His hand gripped hers a little tighter.
“Haa…Haa…”

It was deep. Even though he was pressing so deep inside her, EunHa didn’t reject him. Panting for breath, EunHa buried her face into his chest. She could hear his heart racing through his skin. She could hear his truth through his body.
“Why did you appear in front of me and make me like this?”
He slowly slid out and thrust back inside. As their hips bumped together, the sound of their slapping bodies filled the room. EunHa rocked her hips and helped KyungHyun.
“Should I apologize?”

“After the way you’ve toyed with me, I think I definitely



deserve one.”

With a pained look on his face, KyungHyun grit out the words through his teeth. As she met his thrusts according to his rhythm, his hips pumped harder and harder. Her body flinched in reaction.
“I can take whatever you dish out, so I don’t want to send you away. To that disgusting place… I don’t want to… Haa, damn it…!”
As EunHa squeezed him, KyungHyun raised his chin and let out a groan from under her. EunHa sprinkled light kisses along his taut neck.
“I know.”
“What do… you… know…”

He hoarsely whispered as he grabbed onto her bottom and began to slide in and out with sharp thrusts. EunHa licked the beads of sweat on his forehead as her eyes watered. She wasn’t sure if it was because she was so aroused or whether it was due to a different emotion.
“I know it was a difficult, hnng, decision…”

KyungHyun sat up on the bed. Facing her, he sprinkled kisses on her forehead, eyes, nose, ears, and cheeks. The wet noises coming from their lower halves became louder and clearer.
“EunHa.”

He called out to her as sweat rolled down his forehead. He captured her with his deep, dark eyes once again and spoke in a clear voice.
“Stay by my side.”



EunHa looked at him, completely breathless.

“I’m by your side right now, so what are you talking about?”
“When this is all over, don’t go anywhere and stay by my side. Let’s date like normal people.”
EunHa gave him a strange frown. Her twisted face reddened like a ripe apple.
“Do you know how normal people date?”

When she saw his jaw tighten, she realized that he was feeling very helpless at this moment.
“…They go out for coffee, watch movies, eat together, have sex when they feel like it… something like that?”
“People that are in a ‘some’ do that too.”

Unable to take this tickling sensation, EunHa blurted these words out. KyungHyun gave her a light frown. EunHa wondered if she had hurt his pride by rejecting him. KyungHyun hesitated before answering back.
“…What’s a ‘some’?”

“It’s how the young kids date these days. You haven’t heard of it?”
So this is what he looked like when he was embarrassed. Even though his expression didn’t change, his ears slightly reddened. EunHa opened her pouty lips as she explained. KyungHyun buried his face into her neck and sharply bit down.
“Then do it with me. Whatever you called it. ‘Some’.”

After having her sensitive skin sucked, EunHa heard KyungHyun’s



low voice in her ear. Her shoulders trembled as she laughed. He sharply bit down on her round shoulder.
“It’s embarrassing, so don’t make me repeat myself.”

He slid his penis back into her. EunHa liked hearing his cold voice waver with desire. A tingling sensation traveled up her spine and spread throughout her body. As she felt him press and grind into her, EunHa grabbed onto his wide back and brought him closer to her.
As his tempo and the power behind his thrusts increased, she was no longer able to laugh. She felt as if she was hanging onto him as the world spun around her. In the midst of all this, KyungHyun consistently hit her sweet spot over and over again.
“Ah, nng! Nnng! Haahngg… Aagh!”

EunHa fell onto her back. KyungHyun grasped her breast and squeezed it harshly. His slippery, hot cock pumped into her wet entrance with increasing speed. She felt the pleasure gradually build up in her lower stomach.
“Haagh… Hnng… Hng, aah!”

Tears began to flow out of her eyes as the intense pleasure overcame her. KyungHyun lapped her tears like a dog as he held her trembling body in his embrace.
Towards the end of her climax, EunHa kept her eyes shut as her body continued to quiver. She felt as if the pleasure burst out of her body, vibrating from her head to her toes. KyungHyun sucked on her lips as he placed a kiss there before murmuring in a low voice.
“Did you cry because it was difficult? Or did you cry because it felt good?”
“Haa… Why does that matter?”



“I don’t want to be a bastard that makes a woman cry by making it difficult for her. If you cried because it felt good, that’s fine.”
EunHa laughed as tears continued to flow out. This man was being serious. She felt that she could tell whenever he wasn’t telling the truth. So this is how it felt to have sex with an honest man.
“I cried because I was disappointed. I felt that the night was too short.”
“You’re not going to regret those words, are you?”

“Of course not. How could I not know my lover’s bedside manners?”
He looked at her strangely before frowning as he laughed. “Then can this lover reveal a lot more to you?” “…Why are you suddenly asking… Aagh!”
EunHa’s words ended in a moan. KyungHyun had lodged his teeth into the nape of her neck as he thrust inside her once again. Every time their lower bodies bumped into each other, the mattress springs creaked loudly. Their panting breaths and moans, the sound of their skin slapping together… These noises filled the room.
It was a long time before the dim sunlight entered through the windows and illuminated the disappointed lovers.
Nineteen hours later. Incheon. Chinatown. Crack!
A welt appeared on EunHa’s shoulder before the blood burst out. SungHo used his leather belt like a whip, causing her skin to rip open. Her beige slip was already covered in blood.



EunHa looked up at SungHo with dazed eyes. This time, a thick hand flew in from the left and struck her cheek. As the inside of her cheeks hit her teeth, bright red blood began to drip out from between her lips.
Smack!

SungHo’s hand came down on her head, causing her body to stumble before falling onto the ground. The dust on the carpet of SungHo’s office flew up in a puff.
“Get up.”

Throwing the leather belt onto the floor, SungHo grabbed her by the hair and pulled.
“Boss, at this rate, she might really die.”

YongJoon approached the panting SungHo and spoke up in a strained voice. When a taxi had stopped in front of the building and obnoxiously honked its horn, he didn’t know what to expect. But it wasn’t this.
Just as SungHo had sent him down to find out what kind of crazy bastard was brave enough to do something like this, he saw none other than Lee EunHa step out wearing a slip dress.
As soon as he saw her, SungHo burst out of his seat and began to beat her. YongJoon didn’t even have a chance to hold him back. Even though her body was now covered in welts and bruises, SungHo didn’t relent.
“You fucking bitch… If you came here with your own two feet to meet your death, then I’ll gladly give it to you. Isn’t that right, Lee EunHa?”
His large hand grabbed the nape of her neck. Unable to breathe, EunHa frowned as she she gasped for breath. As the blood rushed to



her face, her pale complexion instantly turned red.
“You shitty bitch… How dare you disregard the grace you’ve received as I raised you. How dare you go and do something like that!”
EunHa’s slender hands flayed about before she grabbed onto SungHo’s jacket. Just before she fainted, SungHo finally relaxed his grip on her.
“Haa…! Cough… Cough, cough…!”

Tears poured out of her bloodshot eyes. SungHo’s other hand was still grasping her hair.
“Bring me my knife. Let’s cut ourselves some fresh sashimi.”
Without looking back, SungHo barked out an order. YongJoon hesitated and called out.
“Boss.”

“Fucking bastard, go and get it right this instant!”

SungHo’s voice tore through the silence as he roared. YongJoon helplessly walked over to the desk and took a knife out of the drawer. As soon as SungHo received the knife, he held the sharp blade up to EunHa’s face. As she felt the familiar glide of the knife on her cheek, EunHa began to gasp for breath. Her pupils were dilated as they shook.
“If you have anything you’d like to say before you die, say it. Try to give me any excuse you can think of before I slice your pretty face open, you bitch.”
“What…What do you want me to say?”



EunHa blurted out bitterly, reigniting SungHo’s fury. The veins in his hand throbbed as he held the knife to her face.
“Is that all you’d like to say as your last words?”
“I shouldn’t have… shot at Noh HyungChul. But you never told me I wasn’t allowed to… Ugh!”
“Do you think you’re making sense right now?! Because of you, we almost got drawn into this mess, completely unprepared!”
SungHo yelled as he punched her stomach. Covered in tears, EunHa’s face crouched down as she gasped for breath. She couldn’t say anything through the pain. Holding herself up with her hand on the ground, EunHa began to blurt out one word at a time.
“I did everything… you asked me to do, Ahjussi… But… Ugh… He’s the one who killed my parents… So isn’t alright… If I just put one bullet in him?”
A strange gleam flashed across SungHo’s eyes. Up until now, EunHa had never gone against his orders. When he had heard that she had shot Noh HyungChul at the KeumOh founding party, he couldn’t help but be suspicious of her.
However, he was able to understand why she wasn’t able to sit still when she saw her parents’ murderer right before her eyes. And seeing how she continued to speak nonsense, it seemed that she hadn’t realized the truth of what had happened 10 years ago.
His suspicions towards EunHa began to shrink, but it didn’t completely disappear. SungHo sucked in a ragged breath and held the knife up to her neck.
“Why did you come back? What did Shin KyungHyun order you to do? Did he tell you to kill me? Was that the reason why he let you go?”



“Ahjussi… Do you think I came back… because Shin KyungHyun let me go?”
EunHa’s eyes gleamed from behind her tangled hair. SungHo brought his face closer to hers. As the knife pressed into her neck, red blood began to seep out. He took the bloody knife and tapped it against her lips.
“If you keep talking bullshit, I’ll rip your pretty lips all the way up to your ears.”
If Lee EunHa actually betrayed him after working for him for 10 years, SungHo was going to do much worse. As he whispered his threat, EunHa helplessly mocked herself.
“I was locked away, handcuffed inside… and I risked my life and escaped… But as soon as I come back, I’m treated like this. I feel like my life is fucked up at this point…”
Her tears poured out and ran down between her tangled hair, dripping onto the silver blade of the knife. SungHo glanced at her wrist as her hands grasped the floor. There seemed to be a bright red mark on it, but she didn’t seem to be hurt anywhere else.
A scar from a bullet wound was left on the back of her shoulder, but it was clear that it was properly treated. When she appeared in this office, she seemed perfectly healthy, almost mocking the state that he had been in for the past few days. Seeing her glossy skin obtained from eating healthy meals, SungHo felt the rage boil inside his stomach.
“I asked you what that poisonous bastard ordered you to do by letting you free. I won’t ask you a third time, Lee EunHa. Think clearly before you answer.”
“Shin KyungHyun… that crazy bastard is probably fuming right about now after discovering my absence.”



EunHa’s eyes narrowed as KyungHyun’s name left her lips.
“…What kind of game are you playing at this time, hm?
Shin KyungHyun did what?”

“It’s just as I said. He wouldn’t have even imagined I’d be able to escape, so he’s definitely furious.”
The one who had taught her the ways of a Serim gangster was SungHo himself. There was no way he didn’t know EunHa’s MO. Tricking a man was something she did best.
TN: ‘Some’ in Korean is short for ‘something’. In English, I guess the closest translation is to ‘have a thing’ for someone. You’re not officially girlfriend or boyfriend, but you still have a thing with each other. Unofficially official.






“It will be in your best interest not to do anything useless.” “I’m only telling you the truth.”
Just as EunHa mumbled in a low voice, the cellphone from SungHo’s desk vibrated loudly.
“Boss, it’s a call from Shin KyungHyun.”

After checking the phone for the caller ID, YongJoon called out. The scar on SungHo’s brow twitched as he frowned. EunHa let out a raspy laugh as the blood continued to drip out of her swollen lips.
“I didn’t just shoot Noh HyungChul. I did everything you asked, Ahjussi. I put my heart and soul into it and managed to seduce that bastard. Just like you wanted, that man is now completely crazy for me.”
Vrrr. Vrrr.

The phone continued to vibrate on the desk and almost fell off.
YongJoon grabbed it and walked over to SungHo as he asked.

“What should I do?” “Turn it off.”
YongJoon did as he was told as SungHo’s lips silently stretched into a smile. His snake-like eyes sparkled as they looked at her. His slitted eyes gazed down at her as he spoke in a thin voice.
“…Tell me everything the bastard did to you from start to finish.”



“What are you going to tell Kang SungHo when he asks you why I didn’t kill you?” “I’ll tell him the truth.” “Which is…?” “Shin KyungHyun-nim has completely fallen for me. So even though he knew I was a spy sent from Serim, he didn’t kill me and kept me locked away in the hotel as he licked and sucked me day and night.” “Lee EunHa-ssi.”
EunHa looked SungHo dead in the eyes and spoke to him in a steady voice.
“After being shot and losing consciousness, I woke up and found myself at the hotel. At first I thought they were going to kill me, but that wasn’t the case. Shin KyungHyun kept me locked away in the hotel and embraced me every single day. Half the time, we had sex twice a day. No, it was even more than that.”
SungHo’s eyes gleamed at her, almost as if he wanted to choke her. However, EunHa continued to speak with even more vigor.
“You ordered me to make him fall for me completely, and I followed your order word for word, Ahjussi. Shin KyungHyun is absolutely crazy about me, and I even got him to shoot his own men at YongSung!”
“Do you think Kang SungHo will believe you?” “Um… probably?”
SungHo took a cold finger and slowly drew it down her face. His thin lips smiled crookedly.
“Our little rag princess… were you born with the talent to seduce men?”
EunHa didn’t avoid his finger even though it felt like a cold bug crawling down her cheek.
“I learned it all from you, Ahjussi. How to survive, how to



tempt men, all of it.”

“Then you should have just lived next to Shin KyungHyun’s side. Why did you put yourself in such danger by coming all the way over here? Did you not enjoy living as his lover? Was his dick ramming into your loose lips not enough for you?”
As SungHo continued to press her with questions, EunHa let out a dejected laugh. Her watery eyes gave off a dim glow.
“Having sex is something I can do with anyone. Every son of a bitch will move their dicks around until they’re satisfied and leave when it’s over. But…”
“…But?”

“No matter how much of a mess I become, I only have one home to return to.”
“Lee EunHa-ssi, you cannot approach Kang SungHo when your safety isn’t guaranteed.” “Just like you said, Lieutenant, I know what excites Kang SungHo. I know it very well.”
EunHa silently gazed at SungHo as a nasty smile stretched across his face.
“Shin KyungHyun told me that everyone in YongSung believes I’m dead. He told me nobody from Serim was looking for me. He told me not to even think about going back.”
EunHa blinked her large eyes at SungHo. Behind her tangled hair, SungHo saw two large eyes staring back at him. It reminded him of when he met her as a little girl.
“I thought it was all bullshit, but…”

EunHa’s eyes filled with tears. SungHo watched her as he stretched his hand out to grab a cigarette from the desk. After



lighting it, SungHo let out a long breath through his teeth. EunHa continued to mumble through the smoke.
“I… I thought I only had this place to return to, so I came back. But should I have not come back after all?”
EunHa mumbled with blood still running down her lips and her throat swollen from SunHo’s hand.
“My parents are dead, and when no one stretched out their hand, the one who saved me was you, Ahjussi… Serim is now my home… If I come back home and you ask me what I’m doing here, how am I supposed to answer that?”
The tears that had been welled up in her eyes finally began to trickle down. EunHa grit her teeth. Frowning, SungHo stared at EunHa as she blurted out her words. Her voice sounded thin and hoarse as it wavered.
“I really thought you believed I was dead. I thought that there was no way you wouldn’t try to get me out if you thought I was still alive. I thought you’d get me out no matter what.”
“Hey, it’s not like Boss didn’t send anyone all this time…”

Crash!

YongJoon stopped talking as the crystal ashtray and liquor glass smashed onto the floor. After flipping over the entire table, SungHo bit down on his cigarette as he took a deep drag.
“I thought that after Shin KyungHyun had his fill of me, that bastard would just kill me like an animal. So… I barely managed to escape, but… I thought I’d try and get any information I could while I was locked away, but… was it all for nothing…?”



EunHa bit her lip and cursed under her breath. SungHo watched her, but his expression remained the same. EunHa took a deep breath.
“Maybe it would have been better if I just died there.”

She murmured with dazed eyes. She grabbed SungHo’s discarded knife off the dirty carpet. Suddenly, someone grabbed her hair and pulled her head up.
“Aagh!”

She felt like her hair was being pulled out by its roots. She trembled in pain as SungHo asked her a question in a gloomy voice.
“What information did you get out of that bastard Shin KyungHyun?”
“It doesn’t matter anymore, right? You won’t even trust whatever I say.”
Her sharp eyes were filled with resentment as she murmured bitterly.
“I trust your skills. Who do you think raised you?” “……”
“The young brat who didn’t know how to do anything but cry… Who do you think raised her and cared for her up until now?”
“Kang SungHo is the most excited whenever he feels superior. He gets his rocks off whenever he steps on his opponents.”
“Answer me. Before I rip your scalp off your head.”

EunHa winced in pain as she answered him.



“The business YongSung is developing in China isn’t a new type of medicine.”
“…Then what is it?” “Philopon.” “What?”
Suddenly, SungHo’s brows furrowed deeply and the scar on his eyebrow twitched.
“They combined forces with the Chinese mafia and established a lab in Shenzhen. Now they’re developing the drug in large quantities. YongSung is the one funding it, and they’re planning on smuggling it in before distributing it in the country. That’s why they met with Kim MinSung. They’re going to ship it in containers, and they needed him to deal with customs.”
SungHo’s stare pierced through her in silence. She couldn’t tell what he was thinking.
“I overheard it before I shot Noh HyungChul. Originally, Noh HyungChul was planning on going to Shenzhen as well. However, now he’s lying in the hospital, so I think Shin KyungHyun will be going alone…Agh!”
SungHo’s grip on her hair tightened. Damn it. Doesn’t he believe me?
EunHa swallowed, but her mouth was dry. Suddenly, he pulled her into his arms. EunHa panted for breath as she was pressed into his embrace.
“Aah… This is why it’s always best to talk to someone directly…”



SungHo mumbled softly as he rubbed her bloody, beaten skin. For EunHa, being in his embrace at this moment was even more unbearable than when she was being beaten to pulp. She felt the desire to stab SungHo’s neck with the knife boil in her belly.
“Our princess almost got into a lot of trouble just now… Hm?”
EunHa had never felt so shaken as she heard his thin voice murmur languidly.
“If you had only told me sooner, you wouldn’t have had to go through such a painful ordeal. Isn’t that right?”
SungHo’s scar twitched. His dry face cracked as his lips stretched into a smile.
“If I had only known about this earlier, I would have answered Shin KyungHyun’s call and listened to what he had to say. Haha. That would have been fun.”
His thin lips opened as he cackled.

“Historically, once a man falls in love with a woman, only humiliation awaits him… Isn’t that right, YongJoon?”
“…Yes, sir.”

Standing stiff like a screen, YongJoon answered curtly with his hands behind his back. SungHo licked his dry lips. He rubbed his hand over EunHa’s head with satisfaction.
“Good work, Lee EunHa. Well done.”

EunHa’s body shook inside his embrace. He had been beating her like crazy just a moment ago, but now he was patting her back like a complete lunatic. She felt as if her body was going to burst into flames with rage. She raised one of her arms and hugged him back.



“Eugh…”
A suppressed cry burst through EunHa’s gritted teeth. “Are you that upset that I didn’t trust you?” “Ugh…”
“Haha. It’s been a while since you cried like a young brat.
It’s okay. It’s all over now. You’ve endured it well.”

Her ten fingers pressed into his back and trembled. She bit her lips as rage and sorrow mixed together, causing her to moan out. She couldn’t stop the cries. She couldn’t control herself anymore. As SungHo caressed her open wounds with his hands, he felt a burst of desire.
“YongJoon.” “…Yes, Boss?”
“Since our princess has come back after having worked so hard, why don’t we have a party at someplace nice today?”
His voice sounded bright and satisfied. EunHa held back the urge to bite her tongue and continued to repeat the same thing over and over to herself.
This is all for her own purposes. This was all the steps necessary for Kang SungHo to feel the intense shock at her betrayal. The ending credits weren’t rolling just yet, and her revenge was currently in progress. Her life wasn’t some new-school drama. It was a satisfying action movie. It wasn’t a tragedy. It was a comedy. So she still had the ability to laugh whenever she wanted.
“How does that sound, Lee EunHa?” “…I’m looking forward to it.”



EunHa’s voice was hoarse, and her face was covered in tears and blood.
“Take her away and let her gussy up. She needs to live up to her title as Serim’s princess. Call Madame Jung and tell her I’ll be heading over in the evening. Tell her to prepare ten girls for me.”
SungHo’s lips pressed onto her forehead. EunHa felt as if a centipede was crawling on her skin. She tightly shut her eyes.
“…Are you alright?”

Seeing that EunHa was being dragged to a different location, General Manager Cha suppressed his anxiety and asked quietly. The owner of this old building was suspicious when they offered to rent out this mold-infested room, but when General Manager Cha took out the bundle of cash, the owner immediately handed them the keys.
“I’m fine.”

Focusing the gun on Kang SungHo’s head through the window without moving a muscle, KyungHyun suddenly got up from his seat. His white shirt was drenched in sweat.
“Let me go and get you something to drink.” “Why?”
Even though cold sweat was dripping off the sharp lines of his face, KyungHyun didn’t realize his current state. He continued speaking in a low voice.
“If you go out now, you might be caught by the men at Serim. We’ll move once the sun goes down.
If they were worried for her safety, following EunHa to this place was something they shouldn’t have done. They had injected a tracker



into EunHa’s inner forearm, and they thought their surveillance of her would end there. No one expected KyungHyun to follow after her himself.
When Kang SungHo took off his belt as soon as he caught sight of her, General Manager Cha immediately glanced at KyungHyun. Aiming his gun, KyungHyun’s shoulders stiffened.
When Kang SungHo turned off his phone at KyungHyun’s call, the air inside the room froze. The verification chip in EunHa’s body didn’t have an eavesdropping function. KyungHyun threw his phone onto the ground and aimed his gun at SungHo’s head. His expression looked like he was ready to kill at any moment.
“General Manager Cha.”

KyungHyun took a drag of his cigarette and slowly parted his lips. His voice was as steady as always, but General Manager Cha could tell that he wasn’t happy at all.
“Yes, what is it, sir?”

“I heard that you applied to this team because of Lieutenant Han.”
“…That’s true, sir.”

“Haven’t you ever thought of quitting this dangerous work and just going back home?”
He was speaking about the fact that General Manager Cha and Lieutenant Han had been engaged for 6 years but haven’t gotten married due to their work. General Manager Cha hesitated before answering his question.
“…It’s not only up to me, and the other person isn’t planning on doing that anytime soon.”



KyungHyun exhaled the gray smoke as his eyes narrowed.

“If something happened to Lieutenant Han, I know that you won’t be able to bear it even more, General Manager Cha. Not with your personality. Is that okay with you?”
After entering Serim, KyungHyun was sent into YongSung and found his footing in KeumOh. Around this time, his superiors ordered for someone else to go undercover and assist him by his side. The frontrunner for this position was Lieutenant Han, a police officer who had majored in criminal psychology as a profiler.
However, team member Cha JoongWon stepped up and vehemently volunteered. It turned out these two had been in a long- term relationship starting from their 20’s. When the superior officers learned of this, they tried to change their decision.
“No, of course not.”

There was no way he was okay with that. KyungHyun knew this answer, but he still asked the question. General Manager Cha realized why and spoke up.
“But since this is what Lieutenant Han wants, there’s nothing I can do about it.”
“Isn’t that frustrating?”

“Even if it is, there’s nothing I can do about it.” General Manager Cha looked at him and smiled bitterly. “I’m the one to blame for liking a woman like that.”
KyungHyun knew this feeling very well. He leaned his head back onto the wall and took another deep drag of the cigarette. Intense agony was mixed in with the thick, gray smoke as it left KyungHyun’s lungs.



“I think Lee EunHa-ssi is doing a good job.”

General Manager Cha earnestly spoke up. He noticed this during their emergency meeting last night as they were figuring out their plan. Lee EunHa had nerves of steel and was intelligent and incredibly observant.
“There’s one thing I’ve been wondering about.” “What is it?” “General Manager Cha, are you dating Lieutenant Han?”
EunHa suddenly asked this unexpected question while they were in the middle of planning their next move. Everyone was taken aback.
“I think that question has nothing to do with our work…” “Ah, I was right. I was just curious, that’s all.”
Lieutenant Han frowned and KyungHyun covered half his face as he silently laughed. Grabbing her fourth slice of the pizza they had ordered through room service, EunHa didn’t seem nervous at all even though she knew she would be put right in the middle of danger. It was truly a shame to let her rot under Kang SungHo’s thumb.
“Call Shenzhen and tell them I want to move the date closer.”
KyungHyun’s soft murmur broke General Manager Cha out of his thoughts. Their actual D-day was in 2 weeks.
Lee EunHa’s job was to get Kang SungHo to take the bait. When Kang SungHo left the country, the surveillance on EunHa would lessen, allowing them to extract her. It wasn’t that General Manager Cha couldn’t understand KyungHyun’s desire to take her out of a dangerous situation as soon as possible, but this plan was risky.
“Shin KyungHyun-nim, Im SungJoon might find that suspicious. He’s very observant.”
Even though the boss, Noh HyungChul, was currently in critical



condition in the hospital, leaving the country now was unreasonable. Right now, Im SungJoon, the one in charge of operations in Busan and Kyungnam, had sent his men to aid in the caretaking of the boss along with KyungHyun’s men.
Once Noh HyungChul gained consciousness, he didn’t enforce disciplinary action on KyungHyun. Instead, he decided to send Im SungJoon to Shenzhen along with KyungHyun. On KyungHyun’s end, it was actually for the better. Even though he had lost considerable influence within YongSung, Im SungJoon was still a force to be reckoned with and was an important figure within the organization.
“It doesn’t matter. Even if he finds it suspicious, there’s nothing for him to find out.”
“I understand. I will request the cooperation of the Chinese public security department and the Hong Kong police.”
KyungHyun seemed to be set on this decision, so General Manager Cha merely nodded his head and walked out of the room.
Whoosh, whoosh. The ceiling fan blew a soft breeze into the room. KyungHyun leaned his head against the wall. His racing heart didn’t show any sign of slowing down. His hands were damp with sweat. He felt that he had sweat so much that his underclothes were drenched as well. The blood was circulating so quickly in his body, and his lips were dry. KyungHyun swept his face with his hand.
General Manager Cha wasn’t wrong when he said EunHa was doing a good job. The problem was KyungHyun himself.
“……”

Until now, he had never completely put himself into something. Afraid of becoming addicted as a gangster, he cut off alcohol, drugs and gambling. He made an effort so that he wouldn’t get too involved in one thing or another.



Like a butterfly risking its life as it threw itself into the flames, this woman was being beaten to pulp by Kang SungHo. In the final moments, KyungHyun watched as she was pulled into SungHo’s embrace with tears rolling down her face. KyungHyun felt his blood run cold. No, maybe it was the opposite. He felt rage flow through his veins, and his blood felt like it was going to boil out.
This is a serious sickness.

Even though he had asked EunHa to refrain from killing Kang SungHo, he was the one who had been pointing a gun at his head, ready to blow it off at any second. To be honest, his hands were still shaking as he suppressed that urge even now. Until now, he had killed many men in order to progress with this mission. What was adding one more to the list? KyungHyun seriously considered this.
Revenge was Lee EunHa’s life. He could imagine how she felt when she had realized the truth after enduring everything for 10 years. This was the only ting that kept him from completely losing his reason.
He wanted to give her anything she wanted. However, if he had to witness something like that with his own eyes again, he didn’t think he could endure this any longer.
KyungHyun moved his piercing gaze to the building next door, and a mumble left his dry lips.
“…It’s crazy to feel jealous in a situation like this, right?”

He didn’t want to act like a besotted punk, but it was easier said than done. Is this what it felt like when one’s reason and body no longer functioned together? His heart continued to race inside his chest.
“I… knew that you’d end up making me crazy in the end.”

He didn’t have the luxury of being disappointed with himself. He



didn’t care about this mission anymore. All he could think about was how to extract EunHa out of that dangerous situation.
“Fuck…”

His body throbbed, and he felt like his head was boiling. It seemed that he had completely lost it now. KyungHyun shut his heavy eyelids and put his forehead against the dirty window. He thought to himself.
Don’t make me endure this for too long, Lee EunHa. Don’t make me completely lose my mind.







EunHa gulped down a shot of gold whiskey in one shot. The warm liquor burned her throat as it went down. One wasn’t enough, so she filled her glass back up to the brim.
“Aagh! Aahng! Haa!”

On the opposite sofa, a naked woman was pressed down by SungHo as her shrill moans filled the room. The two other hostesses rubbed their exposed chests on him as they caressed him.
“Quit your moaning and shut your mouth.”

SungHo had been pumping his hips violently but stopped and took out his cock before pushing the woman underneath him to the side. Then he grabbed another woman who had been sitting on the sofa and placed her on top of him. He lifted her hips and began thrusting again.
‘Fuck…’

EunHa swallowed the curse back down and smiled seductively at SungHo. The large room was illuminated by red lights and was currently a complete mess. The madame of this establishment was familiar with SungHo’s preferences and continued to send in naked women for him.
“Don’t breathe so hard, you fucking bitch. It ruins the mood, fuck…”
SungHo growled out the words and grabbed the woman’s hair and



pushed it away from his shoulder. His eyes turned to EunHa, who was sitting on the opposite couch, drinking her liquor. EunHa had already experienced this kind of situation multiple times before, but it was nauseating every single time.
“Hng! Nng!”

She found it laughable that Kang SungHo wasn’t able to become aroused unless he was having this kind of abnormal sex. EunHa’s shoulders shook as she laughed. SungHo’s movements became more rough and wild.
Click.

The last woman left the room, and SungHo began to smoke a cigarette. As soon as EunHa put a cigarette into her mouth, SungHo leaned towards her and lowered his head. SungHo transferred the orange glow at the end of his cigarette to hers. EunHa drew her head back and took a deep drag. SungHo swallowed to moisten his dry throat and began to speak.
“You look like you’re having a good time.”

“What’s there to dislike? I’m drinking some good liquor.”

EunHa answered nonchalantly. YongJoon had rubbed some medicinal salve on the places where SungHo had beat her, but the skin still prickled.
“Good. Drink until you get sick of it.”

EunHa nodded at SungHo’s words and filled her empty glass to the brim once again.
“About Shin KyungHyun.”

SungHo observed EunHa’s reaction as he brought up the subject. EunHa’s expression reflected on the shiny table surface didn’t



change.

“Yes?”

“Just how much did he tell you about himself?”

EunHa shot down the liquor as she wet her throat. She answered in a straightforward manner.
“Everything.” “Tell me.”
“He told me that he was originally sent from Serim. That you were the one who placed him inside YongSung. At first, I thought he was just talking bullshit, but the more I listened, the more I realized that there was no reason for him to lie about that.”
“That bastard told you all that?”

SungHo frowned before laughing in a hoarse voice. He let out a breath through his thin lips.
“He seriously lost his mind to a woman.”

“Yes, he laughed mockingly as he told me that Kang SungHo was a talentless bastard who merely got to the top but was wasting away all of the resources of his organization.” 
Crash! SungHo threw the glass in his hand at the TV monitor.
“That fucking bastard…”

SungHo bit the inside of his cheek. EunHa reached out and flipped over a new glass that was placed upside-down on the iron tray in front of them. After filling it with liquor, she pushed it over to him.



“So… Aren’t you curious?” “About what?”
“Whether I really sent Shin KyungHyun to YongSung?
Whether he was telling the truth?”

“It doesn’t matter. Either way, that bastard is no longer a part of our Serim family. I’m sure he wasn’t one of us when you first sent me over to him, and you wouldn’t have ordered me to kill him if he was.”
SungHo silently observed her to see if she was being completely honest. Then he slowly opened his mouth.
“Why didn’t you kill Shin KyungHyun? I’m sure you had many chances to do it.”
Ba-dump. That question caught her off guard. EunHa’s heart raced inside her chest. She didn’t show her restlessness and looked straight at him.
“…If I did try, do you think I’d still be sitting here right now?”
“……”

“He would have been a complete gentleman if he merely broke my ankles. In truth, with his personality, he would have probably killed me instead.”
“If Shin KyungHyun wanted to kill you, he would have. Seeing how he hasn’t, it seems that he has completely fallen for just like you said.”
EunHa raised her eyelashes as she sensually revealed her black eyes.



“That was only when I didn’t betray his heart, I’m sure.”

Her voice was wet with liquor and sounded cold.

“Proud men aren’t used to being rejected.”

SungHo laughed. There was some truth to EunHa’s words. Even if Shin KyungHyun was completely in love with a woman, he wasn’t so careless as to lay down his life for her.
“It seems that I need to personally take a trip to China for this matter.”
The long-awaited words finally left SungHo’s mouth. EunHa quietly lowered her eyes as she silently listened to those words.
“I’m going to personally put a knife through that son of a bitch’s throat, so you stay out of town until this is all over.”
“The moment Kang SungHo leaves the country, I’m going to send someone in to extract you.”
KyungHyun and his team members believed that Kang SungHo wouldn’t send EunHa to China. Unable to completely shake off his suspicions, Kang SungHo would go to China himself after extracting information from her. That was their guess, and their guess turned out to be correct.
However, they failed to consider one thing.

“I want to do this with you.”

What they failed to consider was the magnitude of her hatred for Kang SungHo. EunHa needed to see the end of Kang SungHo with her own two eyes.
“What?”

“I won’t make a mistake this time. Please give me another



chance to regain your trust.”

SungHo looked at her with his sunken eyes as he took a deep drag of his cigarette. From here on out, EunHa was on her own.
“I have a plan.”

“As expected, our princess is highly educated. You’re very different from the other gangster bastards around here.”
“What do you think I did during all that time I was locked away in Shin KyungHyun’s hotel room?”
“Okay. Why don’t you tell me this amazing plan of yours?”

SungHo stroked his short beard as he feigned nonchalance. EunHa drew in a short breath before she began to explain.
“Those punks who are currently producing the drugs and doing business with YongSung are a mafia group from Macau.”
“I’m sure they are. So?”

“Please send me to China as early as tomorrow. Before someone from YongSung arrives, I’ll talk to the leader of the group and begin laying down a foundation. Once I find out the exact time and location, I’ll relay that information to you, Ahjussi. You can come to China once I’m finished.”
“And when will we come into contact with those dirty Chinese sons of bitches?”
“There’s no need for you to meet those bastards, Ahjussi.”

SungHo slightly pursed his lips at EunHa’s declaration.

“Why?”



EunHa smiled confidently back at him.

“I’m going to let YongSung make the deal. We’ll make them pay for it. They don’t have the balls to scam the Chinese kids, so they’ll certainly pay the price.”
“Hmph. If they do try something funny, they’ll end up as fish food in the Pacific.”
“Yes. So all we need to do is swoop in and snatch the product from those YongSung sons of bitches once the deal has been struck..”
SungHo’s thin lips stretched into a smile. He took a sip of whiskey and gazed at her with slanted eyes.
“All we have to do is let the bear perform its tricks while we go around and simply sell the drugs.”
SungHo blew out the cigarette smoke before grinding his finished cigarette in the ashtray. He grabbed a piece of green melon that was placed there purely for decorative purposes. He threw it into his mouth and began to chew. Then he gestured at EunHa to come closer.
“…Yes?”

EunHa bent her hips from the opposite end of the table. SungHo grabbed the nape of her neck.
“Hmph…”

Suddenly, the chewed up remnants of the melon entered her mouth. She could taste the sweet fruit as his warm tongue entered her mouth. EunHa tightly shut her eyes as she held back her nausea. She let out a moan as SungHo’s mouth lifted from hers.
“Did I ever tell you this?”



“…What?”
“I like you better than your father.”

EunHa’s strained smile slightly trembled. She laughed forcefully before taking another shot of whiskey. It burned as it went down, but this was the only way she could stop the nausea that was welling up inside her.
“That’s a compliment, right?”

“Of course. If your father could see you know, he’d be so proud of you.”
SungHo patted her head with his cold hand. His snake-like eyes were filled with desire. EunHa felt the hairs on the back of her neck stand up.
“Once this matter is finished, let’s go somewhere warm for a nice vacation.”
“…With you, Ahjussi?”

“Yeah. Think of it as a reward. We’ll go to a good place and eat good food and drink good liquor. What do you think?”
EunHa’s red lips slowly stretched into a smile. “There’s something I really want.” “What it is? Just say the word.”
“If I tell you, will you let me have it?”

“If you get the drugs, we’ll be sitting on piles of money. There’s nothing I won’t be able to get you. What do you want?”
“I want you, Ahjussi.”



SungHo had been lifting his lighter when EunHa said those words. He froze for a moment. EunHa didn’t take her eyes off of him and continued to speak.
“I want to be the person that stays by your side until the very end, Ahjussi.”
The cigarette between his lips shook. After he finally lit it, SungHo managed to answer her.
“Well… You’re quite cheeky, aren’t you…”

EunHa didn’t move a muscle and continued to stare at him.
“Once this is over… take me someplace warm and embrace me.”
Dry coughs burst out of SungHo’s throat. The coughs gradually became laughter. His cackling laughs filled the room with cigarette smoke.
“Haha… Our rag princess.”

SungHo looked at her, his eyes wrinkled with laughter. He continued to click his Zippo lighter in his hand.
“All right. If that’s what you really want, I’ll do it.”

She could clearly see the satisfaction that shone on his face. SungHo hadn’t embraced her because of the memory of her dead father.
SungHo agreeing to her request revealed a lot of hidden meanings. He truly didn’t think she knew about the incident that had happened 10 years ago. Riding the high of knowing that she had nowhere else to go other than back to him, SungHo spoke up in a dirty voice.
“It’s putting me in an awkward position when it comes to



your dead father, but if that’s what you truly want…”
That’s right. Be happy to your heart’s content. Get your rocks off as you see the daughter of the man you stabbed look at you with yearning in her eyes.
“It’s what I want.”

EunHa looked at him with a happy smile. Her wet eyes shook with emotion. Seeing her expression, SungHo became even more excited and let out a booming laugh.
She did feel sorry towards Shin KyungHyun, but this had always her plan from the very beginning. She was going to take Kang SungHo to an unknown location and kill him in the most gruesome way she could think of. EunHa imagined seeing his face filled with utter betrayal in his final moments, and her eyes gleamed.
KyungHyun took out a cigarette from its case and lit it. General Manager Cha stood in front of the desk and checked the time. Then he spoke up in a low voice.
“He will arrive in 5 minutes.” “Okay.”
KyungHyun turned his chair and stared out the glass window. Even though it was now September, the sunlight was still strong. The windows of the skyscrapers in the city all reflected the light.
“Director, are you alright?” “Why are you asking?”
KyungHyun rested his elbow on the armrest and held his chin. General Manager Cha approached him with worry in his eyes. KyungHyun didn’t even look up at him and asked back. There was cold sweat on his temples. The whites of his eyes were bloodshot as



he continued to stare piercingly ahead of him.
“About your current condition…” “I’ve felt worse before.”
KyungHyun had always been too stubborn to speak about how he felt, so when these words left his mouth, it meant that he wasn’t doing well at all. General Manager Cha thought that KyungHyun hadn’t been looking too good for a while now.
He had been assisting KyungHyun for 3 years. Other than the time he had received injuries from a surprise attack, he had never seen KyungHyun look sick. However, as soon as General Manager Cha saw KyungHyun’s sunken eyes when he got out of his car, he knew that KyungHyun wasn’t okay.
“Should I call them and tell them to push back the appointment…”
Before General Manager Cha could finish his sentence, the heavy door of the office burst open. It was pushed back so forcefully that the doorknob banged into the wall, giving off a thud.
TN: Ooooh… KH isn’t gonna like that. He’s not gonna like it one bit.






“Wow, YoungGi. Look at the size of this room! It’s killer!
What kind’a organization fucks ’round like this?”

The voice boomed from behind them as it spoke in a country accent. The untimely appearance of the person they didn’t want to see made KyungHyun frown immediately. The lines in his forehead deepened before they gradually disappeared. He turned his chair around and looked over at Im SungJoon and his lackey who had followed in after him.
“How rare of you to come on time.”

“Of course. I could barely get a wink o’ sleep ‘cus I wanted to see my dear Director Shin so badly.”
“You seem quite energetic for someone who couldn’t get any sleep. As expected, you must love being back.”
Wearing a white three-piece suit that almost seemed to be fluorescent in its brightness, Im SungJoon bared his teeth like a crocodile and widened his eyes.
“Yer right. It is nice to be back. But what have ya been doin’? Eatin’ all the dust in Seoul? Yer face is all shriveled up like a tiny dick.”
KyungHyun remained silent at the obvious ridicule and narrowed his eyes as he exhaled the cigarette smoke in his lungs. Im SungJoon rubbed his hands together and began to speak in an excited voice.
“What, are ya worried now that our boss has woken up? Been thinkin’ ’bout yer future, have ya? Do ya want me to get



ya some of them medicinal tonics? This place next to the sauna I go to makes some fabulous restorative pills. Pretty cheap too. Probably ‘cus the owner doesn’t have a traditional medicine license. I’ll get some for yer servant here while I’m at it. What d’ya think?”
At his offensive words, General Manager Cha frowned behind his silver-framed glasses. Im SungJoon had an ability to push the buttons of anyone he met. Unlike his usual outward behavior of acting like he had a loose screw in his head, he was actually very cruel on the inside.
When KyungHyun had first entered YongSung, SungJoon never took a liking to him. Even now, SungJoon had tried numerous times to kill him in secret.
“Hey, now. Lookit how this bastard’s glarin’ at me. ‘Thank you fer the favor, Hyung-nim.’ It’s only proper ya say somethin’ like that. Who taught you yer manners, ya sumbitch?”
Im SungJoon raised his hand to his hips and began to walk towards General Manager Cha. KyungHyun got up from his seat and stepped in between them.
“Don’t do something absurd by picking on General Manager Cha so early in the morning.”
“Hey, when did I ever pick on him? We’re all part o’ the same family, aren’t we?”
KyungHyun’s lips stretched into a cold smile as he looked at Im SungJoon.
“If you came here to speak with me, then talk to me.” “Alright. But can ya give me a smoke? I came in a hurry to
meet’cha that I forgot mine.”



“That will be a bit difficult.” “What’d you say?”
Im SungJoon dug his finger into his ear as he asked.

“I said I can’t give you a cigarette.” “Why? Are ya bein’ cheap?”
Im SungJoon looked at him as he snorted.

“My office has a no smoking policy.”

As KyungHyun softly replied, gray smoke flowed out of the cigarette between his fingers. Im SungJoon slowly tilted his head.
“…Fuck, since when?”

Im SungJoon’s voice lowered an octave as it left his throat. His small eyes narrowed into crescents, but everyone in that room knew that he was no longer smiling.
“Hyung-nim, let me give you one.”

Im SungJoon’s lackey, Baek YoungGi, stood in front of the door and watched the scene unfold. He didn’t hide his disbelief as he hurried over to them. KyungHyun took a deep drag of his cigarette and burned it down to the filter. He breathed out the the smoke as he answered SungJoon’s question.
“Since just now.”

Baek YoungGi held out the cigarette to his own boss, but KyungHyun lowered the butt of his cigarette and pressed it onto the back of YoungGi’s hand.
“Agh!”



As the cigarette burned into his hand, YoungGi let out a cry in shock and began to shake his hand to cool the burn.
“Ah, hot…!”
“Why ya fuckin’ bastard…”

Im SungJoon’s thick hand flew out and hit Baek YoungGi’s cheek just as the cigarette hit the floor. Im SungJoon yelled out at his lackey whose head had flung back from the blow.
“YoungGi, didn’t ‘cha hear him say that smokin’s not allowed?”
Thud!

“Yes, Hyung-nim!”

Thud! Thump! The sound of Im SungJoon punching YoungGi’s head filled the room.
“When in Rome, do as the Romans do. Isn’t that right?!” “I’m sorry, Hyung-nim… Ugh!”
“No smokin’. No smokin’, ya bastard!”

After hitting YoungGi’s head and face a few more times, Im SungJoon finally got up and dusted his hands. Baek YoungGi also stepped back and soothed his burnt hand as he clenched and unclenched it. He looked up at KyungHyun and General Manager Cha with a fierce gleam in his eyes.
“Aah, how embarrassing for this to happen right in front of Director Shin. Our YoungGi just became a daddy, ya see, so he’s been under a lot of stress havin’ to take care of his baby. Don’t mind him too much, alright?”
“If I tell you that it’s not all right, are you going to kill



him?”

KyungHyun looked at him and slowly spit out the words. Im SungJoon chuckled.
“Ha, our Director Shin is such a punk. Jokin’ around like that.”
Im SungJoon gave him a pat on the shoulder. KyungHyun turned around and walked back.
“Well, let’s sit down and continue our chat.”

The two of them sat at opposite ends of a long table. General Manager Cha called for a secretary outside to bring in some tea. When the secretary came inside and began to place the tea on the table, Im SungJoon swept his beady eyes down her backside and stuck out his thumb.
“Wow… Seoul gals sure develop nice. Must be somethin’ they eat while they’re still growin’.”
“Secretary Song is from Daegu.”

KyungHyun answered in place of the flustered secretary, and Im SungJoon slapped his knee.
“Ah, of course! Our Daegu ladies are noticeable from a mile away. My third wife was from Daegu. Does our baby here have a boyfriend?”
“Let’s end the questions here.”

KyungHyun blocked him with cold eyes. Im SungJoon widened his eyes as if he’d been waiting for this moment.
“Why? I know someone here was so busy boinkin’ a secretary that he couldn’t tell her apart from shit. You



couldn’t even tell if she was a barmaid or a Serim spy and just let a cat enter the fish market. So shouldn’t I at least check out this much?”
KyungHyun glared at him as he leaned back on the sofa before smiling bitterly. Im SungJoon had scheduled an appointment with him to pick a fight. The secretary finally finished setting down the tea and stood back awkwardly, not knowing what to do. After receiving a glance from General Manager Cha, she quickly left the room.
“Fuck, that bitch might be a spy too. What if she put some cyanide into the tea? Isn’t that right, YoungGi?”
“You don’t have to worry about that.” “Why not?”
KyungHyun poured the pu’erh tea into his tea cup and gulped it down.
“Even a cat that enters a fish market doesn’t pay any attention to lumps of shit.”
“Lumps of shit?”

Im SungJoon frowned. KyungHyun nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders.
“I’m talking about myself. Like you said, Director Im, I fucked that woman to my heart’s content. She had many chances to kill me, but I’m still here, aren’t I?”
“……”

“Please have some tea before it cools. It came directly from China.”
KyungHyun lightheartedly gestured to the teapot with his hand as



Im SungJoon glared daggers at him. Im SungJoon calmed himself down before grabbing the teacup and gulping it down. The hot tea burned his throat and caused him to flinch in shock.
“Ah, that’s hot, fuck.”

He wondered how this arrogant punk had been able to drink the tea so smoothly as he shook his head at KyungHyun.
“It’s a shame. Because that bitch is dead, I can’t even interrogate her for answers. But I heard some rumors that Director Shin didn’t want her to be gangbanged, so you killed her peacefully inside a locked room. Is that true?”
KyungHyun slowly turned the teacup in his hand as he replied in a cold voice.
“Did I have such a romantic image inside YongSung?” “Romantic my ass…”
Im SungJoon scoffed at KyungHyun and frowned. Shin KyungHyun had entered YongSung through the recommendation of another YongSung gangster he had met in prison. From the first moment Im SungJoon laid his eyes on him, he immediately didn’t take a liking to him. Even though KyungHyun had a pretty face, he didn’t even flinch as he slit the throat of someone right in front of him.
If he had lowered his head to Im SungJoon, it would have been another story. However, even back then, KyungHyun didn’t lower his eyes as he blatantly looked at him condescendingly.
Even though Im SungJoon did everything he could to get rid of this suspicious man, Shin KyungHyun managed to gain the leader’s trust. Because of this, Im SungJoon was humiliated as he was forced to pull back.
Years ago, when the leader’s nephew, who was ranked as one of



the commanders, brandished a knife against his uncle, Shin KyungHyun took the blow instead and took down the attacker. This event clinched KyungHyun’s place within the organization. However, Im SungJoon believed that it was Shin KyungHyun who controlled the actions of the nephew from the shadows. Because the nephew had completely lost his mind to his drug addiction, this was very possible.
He tried to shake him down, but that slippery bastard got away. And now suddenly, the boss had been attacked again. On top of that, the bitch who had shot the gun was none other than Shin KyungHyun’s woman. Im SungJoon felt that his day had finally come.
He wanted to see Shin KyungHyun fall from his high horse and get on his knees as he begged for his life. Only then would he be satisfied.
“Well, if that were true, it’s quite a tearjerking story.”

KyungHyun looked bored as he lowered his indifferent eyes to his teacup. Tears? This bastard probably only cried once in his life, and that was on the day he was born. That was how dry and stiff he was. Im SungJoon grinned as he vowed to see tears of blood pour out of his eyes one day.
“And not only that. After killin’ that bitch, I heard that ya were in shock and stayed holed up in yer hotel room. Ya didn’t even leave to go to work… like a fuckin’ wastrel. At least, that’s what I heard.”
KyungHyun raised an eyebrow as he frowned. A bark of laughter left his lips. Im SungJoon laughed as well.
“That sound funny to ya?”

“Yes. Doesn’t it sound funny to you, Director Im?”

Im SungJoon licked his bottom lip as KyungHyun mocked him. From his sarcastic voice, SungJoon couldn’t hear an ounce of sympathy in



KyungHyun for his dead woman. Draping his arms over the armrest, with his head leaning back, KyungHyun truly looked like he was enjoying this conversation as he laughed. Seeing this arrogant punk in front of him, Im SungJoon felt anger begin to boil up in his gut.
“Yeah, I died of laughter. Stupid bastards. If you were ever a man capable of havin’ regrets, you wouldn’t have even killed her in the first place. All those bastards laughed and wondered whether you were just keepin’ her holed up in your room to fuck her as much as ya wanted. YoungGi, you sonuvabitch. You fucker. You laughed, didn’t you? Answer me!”
KyungHyun watched as SungJoon picked on his lackey. He opened his mouth and languidly spoke up.
“I’ve already taken care of the corpse, so I can’t show it to you as proof. Would you like me to take you up to my hotel room to see if a rat bastard is living in my home?”
“No need to go that far.”

Im SungJoon looked at him and waved his hand as he declined. Even though his suspicions hadn’t completely disappeared, that fox- like bastard probably covered up all of his tracks. SungJoon felt that even if he wanted to dig deeper, he would only come out empty- handed. He decided to give up on this useless endeavor and just go straight in on the offensive.
“Anyways…” “Yes, what is it?”
KyungHyun crossed his long legs.

“I saw that ya decided to expedite your trip to China by one week.”



“Yes, I did.”

KyungHyun answered curtly.

“Why’d ya do it?”

Im SungJoon asked in a sing-song voice as he picked at the dirt underneath his fingernails. KyungHyun stared at him and answered steadily.
“There’s no reason to drag this out any longer. I thought it would be best to take care of it quickly before all the hyenas caught wind of the rumors going around.”
KyungHyun knew that Im SungJoon had barged in here for this exact reason. This business with China was originally led by KyungHyun. Changing the date of departure wasn’t a big deal for Im SungJoon. He was only doing this because he wanted to pick on KyungHyun’s every move within YongSung.
“Director Shin, I’ll let ya in on a little somethin’ I’ve learned as I’ve lived my life. As a sunbae who has many more years on ya. When people do business, they have to move according to the plan. If ya quickly change things around like an order at a dirty Chinese restaurant, people might lose faith in you. Hm? Honestly, it’s the same at those dirty Chinese restaurants. If ya go in and order a jjajang, then change it to a jjamppong, then again to chili shrimp…”
Showing one’s irritation in front of Im SungJoon only served to further egg him on. Usually, KyungHyun would let it go in one ear and out the other. However, KyungHyun had felt feverish since a while ago and no longer had the patience to do so.
“Director Im.”

KyungHyun cut off the rambling voice. Im SungJoon, who had been spitting out his lecture, stopped and looked at him.



“Yeah?”

“Did you just say ‘faith’?”

KyungHyun poured more tea into his teacup before raising it up.

“Yeah, ‘faith’.”

KyungHyun looked over at Im SungJoon with his sharp gaze. He gulped down the tea in one go and smiled crookedly at him.
“Who are you saying will lose faith with whom? I don’t think I understand you.”
“…I wonder why you’re askin’ me this kind of bullshit. Is there somethin’ ya wanna say?”
“The one who laid down the foundation for this deal and the one who built it up was me. If I’ve done this much, don’t I have the right to change the travel dates as I please?”
Im SungJoon’s brow slightly furrowed underneath his slicked back hair. However, KyungHyun didn’t stop there.
“Or… are you…”

KyungHyun gestured to Im SungJoon with the hand that held the small teacup before folding his arm back and gesturing to himself.
“…speaking of the faith between you and me?” “What a funny, little bastard you are…”
KyungHyun watched as Im SungJoon raised his eyebrows in disbelief. He let out a low laugh.
“It’s funny for me as well. I’m talking about the fact that you’re commenting on the faith between us. To be honest, we don’t have the type of relationship where we will both go



to a Chinese restaurant to enjoy a meal together, are we?”

“So? Are ya tellin’ me to keep my mouth shut like a mute idiot and let ya do whatever ya want?”
Im SungJoon was still smiling, but his voice was not. KyungHyun slowly lifted his cup and wet his throat with the tea. His long, sharp eyes stared piercingly at Im SungJoon.
“Didn’t you realize this would be the case when you were coming to take a portion of my business?”
“Fuck, what did ya just say?”

Im SungJoon’s brows slanted up crookedly. At that moment, General Manager Cha looked down at the cellphone in his hand before looking up with a grave expression. He quickly walked over to KyungHyun and called him in a soft voice.
“Director.” “What is it?”
“Take a look at this.”

“Ya bastard. Who do ya think you’re interruptin’?”

KyungHyun raised a finger and gestured to the growling Im SungJoon to wait. General Manager Cha saw this and lowered his head. After reading the message on the phone, KyungHyun’s face hardened. At the same time, Im SungJoon blew up as he watched KyungHyun blatantly ignore him.
“You sons of bitches, I went easy on y’all, so now y’all are treating me like dog shit, is that it?”
He threw his teacup full of tea straight at KyungHyun’s head.
“Director… Ugh!”



General Manager Cha quickly blocked it, and the teacup hit his back with a thud as the tea spilled all over him. Black fireworks went off behind KyungHyun’s eyes.
“Move.”

KyungHyun pushed General Manager Cha to the side and snatched Im SungJoon’s collar.
“Hyung-nim!”

The lackey who had been standing in front of the door held up a handgun at KyungHyun as if he’d been waiting for this moment. As expected, General Manager Cha snatched his own gun out of its holster and aimed it the lackey from the floor. The tension filled the air inside the director’s office in an instant.
“You fuckin’ sonuvabitch… Let go!”

Even though their builds were similar, Im SungJoon was unable to shake off KyungHyun’s grip. KyungHyun dragged Im SungJoon over to the glass wall by the collar and held him against it. Im SungJoon glanced down at the floor and his body tensed up. Hot breaths hissed out through KyungHyun’s clenched teeth.
“We’ll depart on the dates I’ve picked. I have no desire to change it, so please keep that in mind. If that was all you came here to discuss, you should leave now.”
“Hey, how long do ya think you’ll last acting like a know-it- all?”
Im SungJoon looked down at KyungHyun and smirked. KyungHyun’s grip on his collar tightened. Im SungJoon felt his feet slightly lift off the floor, but he didn’t stop his provoking remarks.
“When Boss wakes up, he’ll throw away people like you. And when that happens, you’ll really die by my hands, ya



fucker.”

KyungHyun challenged Im SungJoon with a sharp glare as he spit out his curses. His black eyes were gleaming.
“Should I kill you first?” “What did ya say?”
“Have you gone deaf with age? Instead of sending you off in an elevator, should I just throw you out the window?”
“Yer true colors are finally showin’. Ya sonuvabitch…”

Im SungJoon’s bulging eyes looked up and down as he took a deep breath.
“I feel pretty shitty right now, so get lost while Boss is still treatin’ you nice.”
“Hyung-nim! Are you okay?!”

Baek YoungGi kept his gun aimed at KyungHyun’s back but made note of General Manager Cha’s gun aimed at him. KyungHyun didn’t move a muscle. Instead, he mocked Im SungJoon in a low voice as he continued to hold him up by the collar.
“Tell him to shoot. This building was built by your shitty construction company, so it’s probably going to collapse. Fuck, just hitting a window with a golf ball will probably destroy one side of the building. I’ll send you off to hell. We’ll go together to make it fair. How does that sound?”
Im SungJoon saw the look in KyungHyun’s eyes, and his smile slowly disappeared. In its place, a different emotion appeared. KyungHyun’s body was incredibly hot, almost as if it were burning. The rage in his eyes was no joke. A murderous spirit was bursting out of his eyes. This could only be seen in those who had faced death



before.

“Lower your gun, YoungGi!”

Im SungJoon shouted, startling his lackey. YoungGi withdrew his gun. General Manager Cha continued to aim his gun at him. Just one mistake, and everyone in this room could die. Im SungJoon feigned nonchalance on his stiff face and placed his hand on KyungHyun’s shoulder.
“It seems that my underlings are lacking discipline. My bad, Director Shin.”
“I apologize for being a bit sensitive today.”

Despite these words, KyungHyun’s hands were still holding on to Im SungJoon’s collar.
“I didn’t understand your heart of wantin’ to finish this business deal as quick as possible.”
“Thank you for understanding it now.” KyungHyun glared at him and spit the words out. “Let’s do well. We’ll work hard in China.”
KyungHyun loosened his grip. Finally back on the ground, Im SungJoon dusted off his wrinkled clothes and swept his hands over his temples.
“This deal needs to be successful so that our boss can let go of his anger and our Director Shin can have a promisin’ future, right?”
“Open the door. Director Im is leaving.”

Even if KyungHyun hadn’t barked out this order, Im SungJoon didn’t feel like staying any longer anyways. He hid his burning rage



and quickly walked across the room. His lackey waiting at the exit opened the door with a stiff face.
“Ah, hey, YoungGi.”

Im SungJoon stopped right before exiting through the door as if he’d just remembered something. He looked at his lackey and held out his hand.
“Give me your gun. You shouldn’t have something so dangerous. I told you so back at the gates.”
“Yes, Hyung-nim.”
“…General Manager Cha, duck.”

In that moment, KyungHyun had an ominous feeling and lowered his body. Bang! The sound of a gunshot rang inside the office. The lackey who had been holding the doorknob slid down onto the floor. Dark red blood began to spread onto the carpet.
“Director Im, what do you think you’re…!”

Unable to hide his shock, General Manager Cha began to speak when KyungHyun suddenly raised his hand and stopped him. Im SungJoon still had the smoking gun in his hand. Im SungJoon looked over at them and shrugged his shoulders as his eyes bulged dangerously.
“There’s no use for undisciplined punks. If yer head’s bad, ya should just die. Don’t ‘cha agree? Even if it looks like I’m about to be thrown from the 40th ﬂoor of this building, how dare he point a gun at ya, Director Shin.”
The lackey he had just shot and killed was a man who had worked underneath Im SungJoon for 5 years. If one included the years he’d been in jail, he had been a loyal henchman for almost 10 years.



Through the open door connecting the room to the secretarial office, they could hear the shrieks and gasps of the employees. Even though the company of KeumOh had its roots in the mob, no one expected to hear a gunshot in one of the skyscrapers of Gangnam in the middle of the day.
“Then I’ll see ya at Shenzhen. Bye. Zài jiàn.”

Im SungJoon grinned as he left the office, not caring for anything KyungHyun had to say. Looking down at the corpse as the red blood bled through the carpet, General Manager Cha had mixed feelings as he chewed his lip.
“…I’ll take care of this, sir.”

It was a shame that they didn’t have any cameras installed in KyungHyun’s office due to security concerns. There was no way Im SungJoon didn’t know about this, which was why he freely did what he did.
As if he’d been thinking the same thing, KyungHyun let out a harsh sigh as he grabbed his tablet. KyungHyun bit his lip when he checked on EunHa’s location. The last place her GFP signal had pinged was at Incheon Airport.
“She hasn’t moved from this location for two hours.” “……”
KyungHyun slowly closed his eyes before opening them again. He had a bad feeling about this. His neck tie felt suffocating, so he quickly loosened it. General Manager Cha could imagine how he was feeling.
“The chip we installed on Lee EunHa-ssi was specially made, so she won’t be able to pass through airport security with it still inside her body.”



“She can if she dug it out.”

KyungHyun spoke in a low voice. General Manager Cha frowned.
“There’s no way…”

She wouldn’t have been able to take it out unless she took a knife to her own flesh and dug it out. However, seeing as how she was willing to risk her own life to shoot Noh HyungChul, she was definitely a woman who could do it.
“Contact Lieutenant Han and tell her to call airport security.”
“Yes, sir.”

KyungHyun took a deep breath as he quickly paced around his office. Although there was no expression on his face, his head was currently a mess. He felt as if he’d explode at any moment. Lee EunHa had extracted the GPS from her body and left for the airport. What did this mean?
If she left the country, it would be nearly impossible to chase after her. They needed to catch her before she passed through airport security.
TN: Absolute nightmare to translate. Im SungJoon speaks in a country dialect and uses a lot of slang. This took me longer than usual, so sorry for the wait! While a lot of readers hate SungHo because of his nasty character, I think I hate Im SungJoon because he’s the most difficult to translate… 






Vrrr.

Suddenly, the phone inside KyungHyun’s suit pocket began to vibrate. It was an unknown number, but he felt like he knew who was calling. KyungHyun’s dark eyebrows twisted.
“Hello?”
– It’s me.
KyungHyun took a ragged breath when he heard EunHa’s voice.
The hand holding the cellphone began to shake.
“…You, what are you trying to do?”
– I’m busy, so I’ll just get straight to the point. I’m on my way to Shenzhen right now. Once the date of the business deal has been determined, Kang SungHo will take note of the situation and follow me to China. So far, he’s only sent one other person to keep watch over me.
“I asked you what do you think you’re doing right now!”

KyungHyun roared into the phone like a furious beast. General Manager Cha, who had been in the middle of a call as he stood in front of the corpse, quickly hurried over to the door and closed it so that none of the other employees could see what was going on.
Boom. Boom. His heart raced so fast that it felt like it was going to burst out of his throat. Unlike his voice filled with white, hot rage, EunHa’s voice over the phone sounded calm.



– All Superintendent Shin has to do is follow everything according to plan. Once you secretly meet with the Chinese mafia and decide on the secret location, you said that the detectives will move in on site, right? That’s how you’re going to catch the YongSung head from Busan and the the Chinese police are going to capture the Chinese mafia. That was the plan.
“Did Kang SungHo, that fucking bastard, send you to China?”
KyungHyun ignored her and began to girnd his teeth. Knowing Kang SungHo, he wouldn’t put it past him to send a woman out on a dangerous mission.
“That fucking son of a bitch… That fucking bastard… I’m going to go and shoot him to death right now.”
His true thoughts burst out of his lips without hesitation. There was a moment of silence before EunHa replied.
⦁	No.
“What are you talking about?”
⦁	I’m the one who offered to go. Kang SungHo didn’t send me.
“Fuck, why?!”

KyungHyun’s bloodshot eyes trembled.

He definitely told EunHa not to leave Korea. Because it was dangerous. Once Kang SungHo left the country, he was going to extract her. So why? Why was she making him lose his mind? Why?
⦁	I’ll tell you the details when we meet.
He liked this answer. His rage was boiling inside of him like a volcano that was about to erupt, but he managed to suppress it. With



a trembling hand, he held the phone up to his ear and murmured.

“I’ll go to you immediately, so don’t take another step.
Don’t move a muscle.”
⦁	I’m getting on the plane in 5 minutes.
Shit. She had already gotten past the security. His twisted expression suddenly disappeared from his cold face. EunHa lowered her voice even more and quickly spoke.
⦁	In the pleasure district of downtown Shenzhen, there’s a bar called ‘Egoist’. I’ll be there.
“What?”
⦁	I’ll be waiting.
The call ended. KyungHyun’s hand trembled as it gripped his hair wet with sweat. It was his mistake believing Lee EunHa would obediently follow his orders.
“Damn it…!”

The cellphone and tablet flew across the room and rolled onto the floor. Unable to hold back his rage, his eyes looked around the room and settled on the golf club leaning against a corner of the room. KyungHyun grabbed the club and flung it in the air. The club hit the glass wall that faced outside and shattered it with a loud crash. The alarm on the ceiling went off and a siren began to ring deafeningly throughout the room.
“Superintendent Shin.”

General Manager Cha, who had always called KyungHyun ‘Director Shin’ for security reasons, was so shocked that he called him by his true title. Taken aback by this unexpected situation, General Manager Cha let out a ragged breath. He couldn’t even approach



KyungHyun. Having worked with him for for many years now, General Manager Cha could say that he had seen many sides to his boss.
When he was angry, he would suppress that anger and turn it back on the opponent. He had even seen KyungHyun break someone’s spirit just through violence alone. Even while doing all these things, KyungHyun remained aloof and cold, to the point where it would bring a chill to General Manager Cha’s spine. However, the KyungHyun right now was far from cold.
“What is the matter? Is everything… okay?”

Having heard the alarm, security guards opened the door and crowded into the room. They saw the mess in the office and stopped in their tracks. General Manager Cha gestured to them with his eyes and quickly commanded them to leave. And like that, the door closed, and they were alone once again.
“Haa… Fuck…”

He had been on edge when he had been speaking with Im SungJoon, but KyungHyun managed to hold it back. However, when he found out that Lee EunHa had gone AWOL, he finally lost all reason. This was the first time General Manager Cha had seen KyungHyun be so reckless. Standing in front of the shattered window of the top floor of the building, KyungHyun panted as breaths hissed through his clenched teeth.
“I’m the fucking retard… I am…”

KyungHyun felt shame burning through his body. It was a horrible feeling. Even though he knew there was a chance EunHa would take out the chip they had installed inside her, why didn’t he do anything about it?
The answer was simple. He had completely fallen for this woman to the point where half of his brain was broken. His desire to trust her



had completely blinded his eyes and his reason.

“It’s dangerous if you stand there. Please step back, Director.”
KyungHyun didn’t move a muscle despite General Manager Cha’s warning. Instead, he looked back at him with bloodshot eyes and issued a command.
“Look for the fastest ﬂight to China.”

General Manager Cha clenched his fist and hesitated. Im SungJoon wasn’t the only one keeping a close eye on KyungHyun’s every move. They had pulled forward the schedule once already. If they moved it again, even their partners in China would begin to become suspicious.
“Didn’t you hear me?” “…Yes, I’ll do that, sir.”
In the end, General Manager Cha could only helplessly nod to KyungHyun. He knew KyungHyun wasn’t the type of man to change his mind easily once he had come to a decision.
“Will you leave immediately?”

“I’ll stop by Noh HyungChul’s hospital before I leave.” “I’ll go with you.”
“No. You stay with Lieutenant Han and observe the situation here. If Im SungJoon and I both leave Seoul, Mayor Kim will definitely come for Noh HyungChul. Don’t miss this opportunity.”
“Understood. Then what about our colleagues in China…” “I’ll contact them. Either way, Im SungJoon is the one who



is in charge of preparing the money. I’ll just go early and tell them I’m sightseeing.”
“If Im SungJoon finds out you left early, he’ll probably follow after you.”
“Then it’ll be for the better. It’ll only quicken our work.”

There was no hesitation in KyungHyun’s cold voice. He was overcome with sudden rage, but it seemed that his judgement hadn’t abandoned him. With that thought, General Manager Cha was secretly relieved.
“While Im SungJoon is in China, you stay here and request an arrest warrant for him. The charges are rape, blackmail, embezzlement, smuggling drugs, and now the murder of Baek YoungGi. Make it so that no lawyer will be able to worm him out of it this time.”
“But the evidence…”

“I’ll personally step up as a witness.”

General Manager Cha’s eyes widened in surprise. By stepping up publicly in court, he was basically agreeing to reveal his true identity. It meant that he would quit his 12 years of undercover life. KyungHyun was determined to conclude everything with this final project. General Manager Cha tensed up at KyungHyun’s words and swallowed, but his mouth was dry.
“Then Kang SungHo… What will you do about him?”

A terrifying gleam flashed across KyungHyun’s eyes. He tightly clenched his fist and spit out his next words in a bitter tone.
“Keep surveillance on him 24 hours a day. If he shows any sign of leaving the country, report it to me immediately.”



“Understood, sir.”

“But don’t let the superior officers know.
“…Excuse me?”

General Manager Cha asked in a low voice. Up until now, there had never been a time they didn’t report their every move to their superior officers. This was the first time KyungHyun had ordered him to do something like this.
“What do you mean by that, sir?”

General Manager Cha swallowed down the anxious feeling that was rising in his chest. KyungHyun swept his hair back with his large hand, the shapes of the knuckles clearly showing through the skin. He continued to look down the building but suddenly turned around and met General Manager Cha’s eyes. His voice remained steady without any tremor.
“I’m going to take care of that bastard on my own.”

General Manager Cha’s eyes slightly shook behind his glasses. KyungHyun wasn’t joking. He had already decided to end Kang SungHo on his own terms.
“I feel like a fucking idiot for having dragged this out for so long.”
KyungHyun mocked himself in a cold voice.

“Superintendent Shin.”

General Manager Cha called out to KyungHyun in a trembling voice. KyungHyun glanced back at him. KyungHyun’s usually cold eyes were now filled with a mix of unrecognizable emotions.
Within his black eyes, General Manager Cha could see rage,



disappointment, and exhaustion. They silently seeped out of his eyes. No less than 12 years. Year after year, all the emotions that had piled up were now on the verge of exploding. General Manager Cha understood. Lee EunHa was merely the fuse as the first woman KyungHyun had shown any interest.
General Manager Cha knew this emotion very well and was very sympathetic. Having joined the police force himself for the sake of his childhood sweetheart, General Manager Cha understood most of what KyungHyun was going through.
“If you have nothing else to say to me, move.”

KyungHyun looked at him with sunken eyes and spoke.
“…Don’t you think you should at least go get checked out at the hospital? You don’t look very well.”
General Manager Cha’s voice was filled with genuine concern. For the past three days, KyungHyun had been suffering from a bone- breaking ache. His whole body was boiling hot, and his body looked noticeably weaker.
“There’s no need to go to a hospital for a mere cold.” “…People die of mere colds all the time.”
General Manager Cha looked beseechingly at KyungHyun, but KyungHyun just pat him on the shoulder and walked past him.
“I’m fine.”

“Please take care of yourself.”

“Just worry about your own woman. Don’t be a fucking retard like me and regret it.”
KyungHyun’s steps were resolute as he walked out of the room.



There wasn’t any time to waste. From here on out, he wasn’t going to let Lee EunHa out of his sight. One mistake was more than enough. He banged his head against the elevator wall. Cold sweat trickled down his neck and wet the collar of his shirt.
The announcement giving the final warning for boarding the flight rang throughout the airport. When EunHa finally left the restroom, YongJoon frowned anxiously.
“Hey, why did you take so long? Are you constipated?” “Where did all your manners go? Up your ass? You
shouldn’t ask a lady something like that.”

“Fuck, humans and animals alike eat and shit, so why’s there a need for manners? Are you some kind of goddess who doesn’t poop?”
Despite his words, YongJoon coughed awkwardly as he scratched his head. There was a slight dent on the right side of his half-shaven head. It was a scar from when she had hit him on the head with an ashtray two months ago. That small circular scar remained hairless on his head. It looked kind of cute.
“Don’t smile like that. You look like a crazy bitch.”

Cursing for no reason, YongJoon began to rummage in his pockets.
He stood still and glared.

“Huh?”

“What’s wrong?” “Where’s my phone?”
He definitely had it with him when he had gone to the smoking room for a cigarette. But his pockets were now empty.



“Hey, did you do it again…”
YongJoon had a frustrated expression on his face as he turned to EunHa who had already started walking towards the boarding gate. He grabbed her purse and looked inside, but it was empty. He had thought that her sticky fingers had taken his phone, but that didn’t seem to be the case.
“Hey, what do you think you’re doing? Do you wanna die?”

EunHa gave YongJoon a fierce glare.
“Fuck… Where did it go?”

How strange.

“Did you drop it while we were shopping?”

That truly seemed to be the case. Lee EunHa, being the superficial person she was, insisted that she needed to buy some high-end products while she was working abroad in a foreign country. YongJoon had no choice but to fulfill her demands.
Declaring that good shoes would lead a person to a good place, EunHa bought him a bunch of brand-name products that didn’t even seem to suit him. That’s where the problem began.
“Fuck, it’s all your fault! Thanks to your shopping spree bullshit, I lost my phone!”
It was time for take-off, and they needed to board the plane now. They didn’t have the luxury of going back to the shops to look for his phone. Frustrated beyond belief, YongJoon roared at EunHa. Thinking nothing of it, EunHa glanced at him.
“Is it a crime for a noona to buy her younger brother some nice shoes?”



“That’s funny. I’m the one who paid for it!”

“But I picked it out for you. Because your eye for design is dogshit.”
“Is that why you bought your things with my card, too?” “You’re so stingy for a grown-ass man.”
“Ah, fuck. My phone!”

A flight attendant watched them squabble with a troubled expression on her face. Just from the look of these two, they didn’t look like they were flying for a normal reason. She had trouble speaking up to them due to YongJoon’s buzzcut and scary outfit. EunHa grabbed YongJoon by the collar and fiercely tugged.
“I can buy you a new phone when we land, so what’s the big deal? Don’t make any more trouble and get on the plane.”
“Don’t you dare spend money like crazy in China.”

YongJoon grumbled with a red face. Behind him, an old lady exited the restroom and began to push a trolley full of souvenirs. EunHa thought that even if YongJoon’s cellphone was discovered halfway around the earth, it wouldn’t be too much of an issue. Her newly- purchased heels shone in the light as they moved.
“EunHa, look at your mom.” “You need to wear good shoes to go to good places. I’m serious.” “You’re only saying that because you like buying heels, honey…”
In her distant memories, her mother scowled at her father from the corner of her eyes. Her father looked back at her lovingly. Looking at her loving parents, EunHa shook her head from side to side.
“You’re sending off your one and only daughter to study



abroad right now. Why are you doing this in front of me?” “Our lovely daughter, fighting!”
After escaping from the house where her bloody parents lay, EunHa only wore good heels from then on. She eagerly waited for the day she could avenge her parents and step out of this sewer hole of a life. And now, D-day was slowly approaching.
TN: Is it just me or do you guys think that KH is gonna slip up somewhere? He’s kinda losing it right now. I feel you, General Manager Cha. I’m as nervous as you are… Is KH making the right decisions? 






68 hours later. Shenzhen, China. Pleasure district.

The red lighting shone down in the dark bar. Now that it was closer to midnight, it was bustling with customers. The price to enter wasn’t cheap, and it only served the best liquors, making it a luxury bar. The person sitting opposite of KyungHyun filled his cup to the brim with liquor and continued to speak excitedly.
[I heard bits and pieces of what happened in Korea. Things like that can happen when it comes to business between men. I don’t think such a big deal needs to be made over something like that.]
KyungHyun smiled and tossed back the strong liquor he had been offered. He felt the aromatic liquor go down his throat and spread out through his nose and head.
[I apologize for any worries the disgraceful scandal may have caused.]
The man who was sharing drinks with KyungHyun was the leader of the largest cartel in China, Li Kahui. With his origins in Macau, the organization had grown into a large mafia group that spread its influence by smuggling drugs.
Because their headquarters were thoroughly hidden and secured and because they alternated their activities between Hong Kong and mainland China, the law enforcement authorities had a difficult time catching them. The Chinese police force was frantically trying to find a way to apprehend them.
[Although it’s unfortunate that the one in charge of this



deal has been replaced in the middle of our trade agreement, as long as everything goes off without a hitch, it doesn’t matter to us.]
He was talking about Noh HyungChul’s decision to include Im SungJoon in this transaction. Up until now, they had only interacted with KyungHyun when it came to this business partnership. Because they highly prioritized their security, it was only expected that they would be unhappy with the addition of a new face.
[Since we only saw Director Shin up until this point… There is a Chinese saying that goes like this. If you meet someone three times, they are considered an old friend. Since this is our third meeting, we won’t needlessly worry.]
The young drug dealer spoke fluent English and smiled meaningfully. At first, his words may have sounded friendly, but it was obviously a veiled warning to KyungHyun. If anything went wrong with the deal, KyungHyun would be the only one to blame.
[My organization is a strong believer in obeying the commands of the superior, so thank you for understanding.]
He needed to reassure Li Kahui. After specifying that the entrance of Im SungJoon wasn’t his own decision but a command sent from above, KyungHyun emphasized that this wouldn’t affect their business deal in any way. If Li Kahui decided to back out now, all of their plans to apprehend them would be tossed out the window.
[Of course I understand. Why do you think I left my old organization and went off on my own?]
Li Kahui took out a sharp cigar cutter to cut his finished cigar. The thick cigar cleanly snapped off with a cheerful click of the cutter.
[Even if the pick is in the pocket, it will always poke out.]

Watching  his  confident  expression,  KyungHyun’s  lips  slowly



stretched into a smile. As if he wanted to bring up the mood, Li Kahui grabbed the liquor bottle engraved with dragons and filled KyungHyun’s glass up to the brim.
[Here, business is business. We came out to share a drink, so let’s enjoy it. I must wholeheartedly receive our guest who has come such a long way. You have a long road ahead of you tomorrow, isn’t that right?]
KyungHyun clinked his glass with Li Kahui’s. The bitter liquor burned as it went down his throat and emptied into his stomach.
Two days had passed since his last phone call with EunHa. Tonight would make the night of the third day. It wasn’t difficult to find the place she had mentioned. Egoist was the most famous brothel in Shenzhen. As soon as he landed in China, KyungHyun had basically set up camp here, but he didn’t see the one he was waiting for.
As more time passed by, KyungHyun felt as if his blood was drying up in his veins. Around this time, Li Kahui appeared. It was a chance meeting, but it was more likely that Li Kahui had been keeping an eye on him ever since he landed. Just like General Manager Cha said.
[If there’s a girl who catches your eye, just say the word.
This place is also under my jurisdiction.]

At KyungHyun’s questioning gaze, Li Kahui grinned.

[There’s no need to separate alcohol from sex. Where there’s alcohol, there needs to be women. And where there’s pleasure, there’s money. I have an incredible nose for money, you see.]
Li Kahui was not merely a VIP member of this establishment. He was actually the business owner. The fact that Lee EunHa had chosen this pace was a crazy coincidence. Those that dabbled in dangerous work lurked in dangerous places like ghosts. KyungHyun swallowed



his scoff as the instincts he had honed as a member of a criminal organization proved to be right once again.
[It seems that the show is about to begin.]

Suddenly, the room was plunged into darkness. Men began to whistle throughout the room. A drum began to pound slowly but gradually quickened. Suddenly, a line of hostesses walked onto the stage from both sides. Other than the red lipstick, make up, and the long strings of pearls hanging from their necks, these slender beauties were all naked.
[What do you think?] [Not bad.]
KyungHyun spoke indifferently as he breathed out the cigarette smoke. Every night at midnight, the show would begin. Instead of entertainment, this was more likely a dispatch of ladies to pick up potential customers for the night. Just to be sure, during the past two nights, KyungHyun had kept an eye out for her, but she wasn’t one of them.
[A new girl comes out every Thursday night…]

The beating of the drum suddenly stopped. The spotlight was focused on the center of the stage. The sounds of whistling men and appreciative claps began to grow louder.
“……!”

KyungHyun focused his gaze on one point. Someone was slowly walking into the spotlight. The woman was wearing very high heels and a Chinese dress. All of the eyes inside the establishment were drawn to her. It wasn’t solely because she was the only one clothed in a group of naked women.
[The qipao seems to suit that beauty very well.]



Li Kahui laughed in satisfaction as he took out a cigarette case. The white powder that had been prepared beforehand spilled out. KyungHyun bit his lower lip as he gazed piercingly at EunHa as she walked on the stage. He felt like his head would explode with the urge to grab her wrist and drag her outside.
[She’s like a red rose. Especially that thorny gaze.]

After snorting the drugs, Li Kahui sniffed and coughed like a dog. KyungHyun’s eyes shook dangerously as they remained glued to the stage. Her white face, her blood-red lips, and her long hair swept up securely on top of her head. Thanks to that, her distinct facial features seemed even more pronounced. Every time she took a step, the diamond earrings hanging down like teardrops shimmered in the light.
[Here, I’ve prepared this especially for you.]

KyungHyun didn’t even look at the drugs that Li Kahui handed over and accepted them. Once the white powder had completely disappeared from the iron plate, it fell onto the table. It felt like being doused in cold water. His mind seemed so clear in an instant, and his heart began to race inside his chest.
His vision clouded over for a moment, but suddenly, everything seemed twice as clear as it did before. EunHa lightly sat down on the chair that had been brought onto the stage. Normally, the slit ran up to the thigh on an average qipao. However, on the dress she was wearing, the slit ran all the way up to her waist.
As if returning to his senses, a man began to beat the drums once again. At the same time, EunHa spread her legs underneath the spotlight. The short skirt of the dress began to ride up her thighs as she slowly opened them, and a thick tension filled the room.
Every man caught their breaths. All the dark eyes glistened as they filled with desire for her. The drumming became louder and faster as



did their heartbeats.

The person with the drumsticks in both hands continued to pound on the drum. Following the rhythm, the women on both sides of EunHa silently fell to their knees.
The garter belt holding up EunHa’s stockings appeared with her movements. The drumbeats stopped, and the sound of the wooden drumsticks clacking together rang inside the room. At this sound, EunHa frowned. As soon as her legs were completely open, her hand went to her side and ripped off the skirt.
Underneath her dress, there was only her garter belts and stockings. There was nothing covering her between her legs.
Click.

Suddenly, the lights turned off.
“……!”

After a moment of silence, someone’s shout seemed the rouse the rest of them. Overwhelmed with lust like savage dogs, the men noisily raised their hands.
[Now, it looks like tonight’s auction will begin. A deal between gentlemen needs to be done silently. Please present your price to the nearest employee near you.]
Once the lights came back on, the men scrambled around with their fingers raised. Standing sporadically across the room, the employees kept exchanging hand signals with them.
[It seems that one of the girls has caught your eye.]

Li Kahui chuckled as he looked at the frowning KyungHyun who seemed to be at a loss for words. For the past two days, he secretly watched KyungHyun enter this establishment. However, Li Kahui



never saw him leave with any of the women. KyungHyun would merely drink liquor until closing time. It seemed that this picky man had finally found someone who interested him.
Suddenly, KyungHyun ripped his gaze away from the stage and slowly turned to Li Kahui. His movements were too smooth to say that he was completely high from the drug. However, his eyes told a different story. He looked like a madman as he bit down hard on his lower lip. His low voice seemed to rumble out of his throat.
[How much for the rose?] “Fuck, seriously…”
As soon as she got off the stage, EunHa was taken somewhere else, and the door was locked from the outside. Unable to hide her shock, EunHa let out a curse. This place was the only club EunHa knew of in the area.
A few months ago, while working the job related to the jeweler, she had overheard someone talk about this place at a party. It was only 30 minutes away from the Shenzhen-Hong Kong ferry and was even connected by land.
‘Why here of all places…’

EunHa hurriedly paced around the room. In order to gain Kang SungHo’s trust, she told him she’d approach the drug traffickers. In order to do that, she needed to pretend to apply for a job here. She planned on working as a bartender as she waited to make contact with KyungHyun, but she never expected things to turn out the way it did.
This high-class bar operated on a membership basis. If she had known that this establishment was a well known brothel, she would never have picked this place.
For the past three days, from the moment she opened her eyes in



the morning until the moment she closed them late at night, she was busy receiving beauty treatments on her whole body. Therefore, she didn’t even have the time to go to the bar. In this building, one entire floor was transformed into a beauty salon where the women could take care of their looks from head to toe.
Normally, she’d hum as she went along with it, but she was incredibly busy right now. She didn’t want to bother focusing on anything else other than her mission for even one hour. She tried to contact KyungHyun multiple times. However, worried that the phone was bugged, KyungHyun had thrown it away and changed his number. Therefore, when she tried to call, all she got was an empty message telling her the number she tried to call was no longer in service.
‘This is why doing your research is important, you idiot.’

She gripped her glossy, well-treated hair and almost pulled it out of her scalp as she berated herself. However, this wouldn’t change anything. She was about to receive her first customer.
After telling YongJoon that the leader of the drug trafficking organization frequented this bar, he unpacked their luggage at a nearby business hotel. YongJoon didn’t understand a lick of Chinese, so he had no choice but to believe whatever she said.
The problem was that she didn’t have the luxury of being locked up in here for too long. And she definitely didn’t want to be pinned down underneath a fat-bellied, Chinese millionaire.
[Please enjoy your time.]

She heard the voice of the waiter outside the door. Her eyes widened in shock.
Damn it. Was it already time?

She didn’t have much time to ponder over this. When she heard



the door open, EunHa moved quickly. Past the big bed and strange lights, she saw a bathroom in the corner of the room.
Click.

As soon as she ran inside, she heard someone enter the room. EunHa hurriedly turned the shower faucet. As the sound of rushing water filled the room, she sat down on the toilet and bit her lips.
‘What should I do?’

Plan A. She could go out and attack the Chinese millionaire. It would be a godsend if he wasn’t a pervert who brought someone else along to share the bed, but if things got noisy, it would be quite troublesome.
Then the only option left was Plan B. She needed to escape without getting caught. However, she was completely trapped in here, so how? EunHa raised her head and let out a deep breath. As she hopelessly looked around the room, she finally saw a small window on the other side of the bathroom.
Please… please…
Stepping onto the sink, she went up and slightly opened the window. A bright smile illuminated her face. The window wasn’t barred and opened with a creak.
When her feet finally managed to land on the ground, EunHa let out a sigh of relief and looked around. She was in a dark, narrow alleyway. She couldn’t even see the hazy light of the bar sign. She saw a narrow door next to her. She believed it was a door leading to the kitchen of a restaurant. The heap of fruit peels and empty bottles seemed to confirm her suspicions. Even though this city was packed with bright signs and buildings, she had still managed to find herself in a dark pocket of the city where no light was in sight.
“They didn’t even give me my daily wage. And now what



have I gotten myself into?”

She spoke aloud the thought that had been running through her head as she crawled down the drainpipe. EunHa reached up and pulled out the red hairpin that was securing her hair in place. Her long hair fell down and covered her face. She could see a large street at the end of the alleyway. For now, she needed to find a 24-hour convenience store and find something to wear as a disguise. Then she planned on hiding herself somewhere nearby.
The reason why she didn’t leave this place immediately was that there was someone she needed to meet. If it wasn’t for that, she would have gone to the hotel where YongJoon was waiting for her and move on to the next step in her plan.
Where could he be?

She never even imagined that KyungHyun wasn’t here. She had even accommodated the bar manager’s order to go on the stage in order to find him. However, she wasn’t able to see him because he was in the 2nd floor VIP room with Li Kahui.
EunHa began to walk quickly as she took out a small cellphone and some money hidden inside her bra. She had argued with the manager furiously when he ordered her to go on the stage naked just so that she could keep this with her. Only when she showed the scar from the gunshot wound and the scar from digging a knife into her skin to take out the GPS chip did the manager angrily agree and give her some clothes.
[Just what did you do before you rolled in here?] [Everyone has at least one story that they cannot tell without shedding tears.]
Thanks to that, she was able to hide her necessary items and keep them with her. Just thinking about how close she had been to escaping in the nude put a bad taste in her mouth.



EunHa angrily flipped open the old cellphone. YongJoon answered as soon as it began to ring.
“It’s me.”
⦁	Hey, what happened? You suddenly disappeared from the stage.
EunHa put a hand up to cover her mouth and the receiver as she answered in a soft voice.
“I’ve successfully made contact.”
⦁	Is the bastard who bought you the leader of the cartel? He stayed in the 2nd floor VIP lounge and never came out, so I didn’t get a look at his face. Well, I guess it would be strange for a leader of such a large organization to be out and about without his lackeys around.
He was normally a dull-witted person, so she didn’t expect much from him. However, he surprisingly went along with the script in her head and managed to follow her into the bar. It seemed that all these years in the mob had thickened his skull but broadened his mind. She never knew that not having to explain herself was this nice.
“You’re right. I was lucky.”
⦁	That Chinese son of a bitch… That rich ingrate. Is it that easy to blow $20,000 dollars for one night?
YongJoon scoffed. EunHa stopped in her tracks and frowned.

“How much?”
⦁	He paid $20,000.
As soon as she heard the number, EunHa felt her insides begin to grow warm. Used as other men’s entertainment only to squeeze herself out of a small window to escape… EunHa felt a sense of disappointment burn in her gut.



“Those fucking bastards.”
⦁	Hey, why are you cursing all of a sudden?
As soon as YongJoon expressed his anger, EunHa brushed off the regret and shook her head.
“Whatever. I need to stick by those sons of bitches and get more information, so just wait for my call. If you hang around the bar, you might catch someone’s eye.”
⦁	You don’t know the date of the transaction yet?
“I’ll probably find out sometime this week.”

EunHa didn’t know that KyungHyun had pulled the date forward.
YongJoon spoke up as if asking for a favor.
⦁	Boss said he would arrive tonight. Make sure you don’t make any mistakes. Don’t make him mad like you did last time. If you mess up this time, Boss really won’t let you off easy…
At YongJoon’s words, EunHa froze. The wind brushed against her cheeks, and she felt a shiver run down her spine. Kang SungHo was coming to China. This meant that they were now entering the final act. EunHa glared into the distance and chuckled.
“Just mind your own business, you bastard.”
⦁	Hey, you fucking…
“I can’t talk for long. I’ll call you later.”

Before YongJoon could reply, EunHa ended the call. After taking out the cellphone’s battery, EunHa threw it into the sewer hole. She was just about to exit the alleyway when…
“Hmm…!”



Somebody suddenly covered her mouth with their hand. Her eyes widened in shock.
Damn it. Had she been caught already?

Even the idiot YongJoon had managed to successfully figure it out. This large establishment had its roots in the mafia. EunHa fumbled with the garter belt on her thigh. She had brought the hairpin with her just in case. Who knew that she’d be using it here? It was made of iron, so it might not be able to pierce through the skin, but she could still poke it in someone’s eye.
“Wait. Let’s talk this out, hmm?”

Once she grabbed the hairpin, she raised her arm with all her might. At that moment, her body was flipped around and her back was pressed against the wall. The man holding both of her arms was panting. EunHa relaxed her arm and the red hairpin fell to the ground.






“…You surprised me.”

“Is that all you have to say?”

When she heard his low, hoarse voice, EunHa felt her heart beat faster. KyungHyun gazed piercingly at her face. Just like that first day at the office when she entered KeumOh as his secretary. It felt like the time she had entered his office for the first time. His face was cold and stiff. No, actually, he looked a lot angrier now than he did back then.
Staring back at his godly face, EunHa felt as if she couldn’t see any warmth in his expression. The hot hands squeezing her wrists seemed to confirm that suspicion.
“Excuse me, it hurts, so can you let go… Hmm!”

Dry lips slammed down and swallowed hers, cutting off her words. His tongue had traces of strong liquor as it plunged into her mouth. When he finally found her tongue, he sucked it into his mouth, causing EunHa to melt in his arms.
“Haa…”

Their panting breaths tangled together as KyungHyun’s sharp nose bumped into hers. In the midst of all this, his hands didn’t relax their grip on her wrists. If she struggled even a little bit, she felt like her wrists might get shattered in the process.
He rubbed his tongue against hers and sucked as if he was going



to pull it out of her mouth. Their saliva mixed together, and the kiss was wet. KyungHyun continued to lap at her like a dog and sucked her mouth. EunHa felt her mind go blank as she panted for breath. After sharply biting down on her swollen lower lip, KyungHyun finally pulled back and spoke in a low voice.
“Do you see me as a fucking retard?”

His hoarse voice shook. EunHa slightly frowned as she heard his coarse voice once again.
“…What’s wrong with your voice?”

“Did you think that I let you go so that you could do whatever you want?”
He was too worked up and didn’t even seem to hear her. His icy eyes were filled with anger as he roughly pushed her against the wall. His gaunt face and sunken eyes were now clearly visible to EunHa. He looked like a madman.
“You were surprised? Surprised? Are you as surprised and shocked as I am?”
His overwhelming, powerful presence didn’t seem to have changed, but for some reason, he seemed even more dangerous than usual. He spoke too clearly to be drunk, and EunHa had never seen him lose his reason from drinking too much anyway. Shin KyungHyun wasn’t the type of man to get drunk from liquor. EunHa felt a sliver of fear run down her spine, and her voice wavered as she spoke.
“…Are you okay?”

“Why are you driving me insane?”

His unfocused, dark eyes shook, and his pupils dilated. The grip on her wrists tightened. Even though it was painful, EunHa felt like his



intense aura was pressing down on her, so she couldn’t even get a word out.
“Why are you making me lose my mind?”

Even though his voice was very soft, it was enough to relay his burning rage. EunHa realized that she wouldn’t be able to soothe him. She knew from experience that at times like this, she needed to be completely honest.
“…I do it so that you will never let me go.”

As soon as those words left her lips, his large hand gripped her small chin. She met his twisted gaze and spoke calmly.
“I want to kill that bastard with my own hands.”

KyungHyun’s rage finally exploded. Curses hissed between his clenched teeth as he flipped her around. His sweaty hands went inside her dress, and she could hear the sound of his belt unbuckling.
“You… Do I mean nothing to you?”

KyungHyun’s heart raced with spite. He wasn’t sure if this violent malice was directed at the words she had just said or at the woman who said them.
The effect of the drug he had received from Li Kahui was strong. He had tried his best to steady his heart as he entered the room where she was supposedly waiting for him. He heard the sound of water coming from the bathroom. Thanks to the last strand of reason left in him, he didn’t immediately break down the door and enter inside. However, it finally snapped when he saw the empty bathroom and the two panels of the small window on top of the toilet.
“Ugh…!”

He felt his mind go blank and the last of his composure fly away.



The thoughts that he had kept to himself began to flow out.

“Do you know how I felt when I sent you away? How much I had to hold back…!”
He pressed her slender body against the wall and began to grind his erect cock against her bottom. Because she wasn’t sufficiently wet, EunHa squirmed when she felt him enter inside.
I won’t send you away. So stay right here just like this. Let’s live together as one body from now on.
His heart drummed against his chest, and EunHa could feel it against her back. Pressed against the wall, EunHa felt a sharp pain and drew in a deep breath.
“…Are you very angry?” “Am I very angry?”
KyungHyun’s cold voice and his hot breaths brushed her ear. Black fireworks went off behind his eyes. His jaw, now covered in a coarse, prickly beard, began to rub against her soft cheek.
“Did you just ask me if I’m very angry?” “Ugh!”
He pulled back his hips and quickly thrust back inside. A small moan escaped from between EunHa’s lips. Her body wasn’t prepared for this. It felt like a stick was penetrating her. She turned her head as she tried to see him, but it was in vain.
“Yeah. I’m crazy angry. I feel like I’m suffocating and my heart has dropped. I feel like I’m going to die of anger at this rate.”
KyungHyun grabbed her head and began to thrust deeply inside.



Because the wall was in front of her, she couldn’t move. All she could do was receive his deep penetrations. Every time he pumped inside, her breasts ground into the rough wall.
“I wouldn’t have let you go. If I knew that you’d run away like this, I would have put both of your hands and feet in shackles and kept you inside that room until this was all over. Do you know that?”
KyungHyun’s panting breaths hissed out from between his clenched teeth and brushed against her skin. EunHa barely managed to grip the wall with her hand as she panted.
“I told you… to meet me here… I didn’t run away.”

“Yeah. I trusted your word and waited for you here. But do you know what I went through my head as I waited?”
“Were… you worried? I told you that there was no need to worry… Ugh!”
KyungHyun dug his teeth into the nape of her neck. Underneath the dizzying pain, EunHa couldn’t help but shiver as she felt KyungHyun begin to suck. No matter how worked up he had gotten, KyungHyun had never lost his composure before. However, that KyungHyun was no longer here.
“Worry? Do you think it ended with mere worry and fear?”

KyungHyun continued to bite her neck like a starving animal as he squeezed her breasts painfully. He continued to thrust violently into her.
“I wondered whether things had gone wrong. Whether you had been caught by Kang SungHo again and was suffering under his hand. Every time those thoughts ran through my head, it felt like someone was digging a knife into my stomach and twisting it.”



The image of her skin bursting with blood as she was whipped by the leather belt never left his mind. KyungHyun constantly regretted not killing Kang SungHo right then and there.
“But then I saw the lackey who charged at us with a motorcycle hanging around here. That’s when I knew. I knew that you had reached China safe and sound.”
“Haagh…! Ugh!”

The sound of slapping skin echoed in the alleyway. His cock pushed apart her folds and ground into her. The swollen veins rubbed against her walls. Once KyungHyun had thrust inside to the root, he mumbled in a shaky voice.
“But you didn’t appear before me like you said.”

For the past two days, worry and fear didn’t even begin to describe the emotions that were rolling through him. Rage and anxiety. Hope and disappointment. These emotions seesawed inside his heart to the point where he felt like he was half-crazy.
“I wondered whether I was tricked by you once again. If that were the case, I thought it would be better for me to just jump off the building.”
His hoarse voice sounded strange as it shook. EunHa received his rough thrusts as she barely managed to turn her head around. KyungHyun’s black eyes were terribly dilated as they shook and glared at her.
“I wanted to snap that ankle of yours as soon as I saw you again. It would be better to hurt you so that you wouldn’t be able to leave anymore. I seriously considered it.”
“It sounds like… hnng… something a thug would say.” “Why are you turning me into a real thug…?”



KyungHyun ran his tongue along her cheek. His breaths were filled with a tangle of suffering and desire. EunHa rubbed his hand that was grabbing onto hers. Suddenly, his eyes began to shake even more. His voice still sounded as husky as it did before.
“Why are you turning me into a lunatic?”
“Wow. Hnng, it looks like you’re really angry… Ugh!” “You didn’t think I’d be?”
KyungHyun had almost lost his mind with rage. No, actually, this anger was almost indescribable. Even though he knew it was incredibly foolish to be jealous of her thirst for revenge against Kang SungHo, he couldn’t help it. He was definitely jealous that her mind was not completely filled with him. There was no other explanation for the emotions that were overwhelming him right now.
“There’s something, hnng… I want to ask you.” “Shut your mouth.”
EunHa didn’t listen to him.

“If you’re that angry with me, why don’t you just break my ankle? Why are you having sex with me?”
As he violently thrust inside her, EunHa gasped and smiled.

“Even though you’re so angry with me that you’ve lost all reason, why are you still holding back?”
KyungHyun’s body shook. EunHa looked at him and softly whispered.
“Do you want me to answer that question?” “I told you to shut your mouth.”



“It’s because… you still like me.”
KyungHyun muttered a curse. Because she had accurately pinpointed what he felt, he couldn’t even deny it. His wet lips began to tremble.
“I missed you too.” “……”
“When I was up on that stage, I was only looking for you. I knew you’d be there, but I couldn’t see you so I was ﬂustered. I’m serious.”
EunHa put her hand on top of his as she softly whispered. She was like a haughty cat rubbing its head on him for affection.
“It’s nice to see you again. I feel relieved.”

Suddenly, it was as if a dam had burst inside KyungHyun’s chest.
His sculpted face twisted.

“Please kiss me. You’re good at kissing.” “Fuck…”
“Do it nicely. Hurry.”

As her lips came closer, it was as if something had snapped inside the darkness in his mind. As if he had lost all consciousness, he couldn’t think a single thought. Their tongues tangled. EunHa wrapped her tongue around his and began to suck. KyungHyun’s body trembled as he roughly crushed her to his chest. He wanted to swallow her whole.
“Hnng…”

His lips sucked on hers before traveling down to the nape of her neck. He shook his hips and buried his face in the space between her



neck and shoulders. A wind blew through the alleyway, causing the liquor bottles and beer cans to roll around on the ground.
“Ah, hnng!”

Her moan was carried away with the wind. Her tight entrance became slippery as KyungHyun’s cock continued to pump in and out. Feeling her body’s reaction, KyungHyun flipped her around once again.
“……”

Their eyes silently met. The man’s gaze swept over her face. His trembling hand grasped her breast. They didn’t know who started the kiss, but in the next moment, their lips crashed together.
EunHa didn’t reject his kiss and returned it wholeheartedly. Through the hazy scent of alcohol, she could smell his scent. KyungHyun unbuttoned her dress and found her soft breasts. EunHa felt goosebumps when she felt him begin to suck her nipple.
“Come here.”

He lifted her leg and entered her once again. As if welcoming him, her walls sucked him in. KyungHyun let out a husky groan and lifted EunHa’s other leg that was in danger of giving out.
“Hold on to me.”

EunHa wrapped both her arms around his neck. Standing up, he lifted her up and rubbed his nose against hers. Then he began to drill into her. Because she was already drenched in both of their fluids, KyungHyun met no resistance as he pumped into her. As his cock continued to rake in and out of her, EunHa felt the pleasure build up.
Although the wall was at her back, KyungHyun propped a hand against it so that the cement wall wouldn’t scratch her.



“You aren’t going anywhere from now on.”

KyungHyun shook his hips as he spoke in a hoarse voice. After being apart, he finally realized how far he had fallen for this woman. Even if his juniors laughed at him for being such an idiotic superior officer, he didn’t care.
“Whether it’s revenge or anything else, do whatever you want. I’ll fulfill all of your wishes.”
“Haa… Nng…!”

“Just as long as you do it in front of me.”

He planned on letting her do whatever she wanted. As soon as he touched her, he realized that there was no other way. As EunHa looked at him with trembling eyes, she wrapped her hand around his face.
“Do it where I can see you. Whatever you want.”

EunHa met his eyes and faintly smiled. Her eyes began to water. She felt as if all the blood had rushed to her head. Thankfully, the chilly wind cooled their feverish bodies.
“Are you so happy that you’re shedding tears? After turning me into a lunatic?”
Although his tone was as cold as always, his eyes were hot. He rubbed his lips against hers. It was true that EunHa was so overwhelmed that she was about to burst into tears. But it wasn’t completely due to their heated, public round of sex.
She felt as if she had finally found someone who was completely on her side. No matter what she did, she knew with complete certainty that a man named Shin KyungHyun wouldn’t block her from doing what she wanted. Even though she felt a bit bashful, EunHa felt a prickly sensation in her heart. This sensation was pumped out with



the blood by her heart and spread out to her fingertips and toes.
“What do I do…?”

EunHa gasped as she looked down at KyungHyun. Her cat-like eyes were watery, making them look like they were made of glass.
“About what?”
“It feels so… so good… I don’t know what to do…”

A fat tear trickled down from her eyes. Letting out a rough breath, KyungHyun licked it.
“…I feel the same.”

After the soft whisper, a hot breath puffed over her. Her hands that were tightly gripping onto KyungHyun’s shoulders began to lose its strength. Noticing this, KyungHyun began to rub her back. EunHa let out a loud cry as she hung onto him.
“Ugh… Haa!”

When KyungHyun finally burst inside her, an unprecedented climax rolled over her. With her eyes closed tight, she squeezed the arm that was holding onto him. Her thighs trembled and her throat felt sore. However, that wasn’t important.
“Don’t pull out. Just for a little while.”

Not surprised by her words, KyungHyun merely gazed at her.

“Of course.”

This was the first time she didn’t want to pull apart after sex. Only when her breaths had steadied did she finally leave his embrace.
EunHa met his eyes as he openly stared at her. She cleanly popped the last piece of the hamburger into her mouth. Although they were



currently in a global-chain fast food restaurant, she felt that the food tasted different depending on its location.
“That was fast.”

“Yeah. This place has good food.”

EunHa gave him a thumbs-up. A short laugh escaped KyungHyun’s lips. EunHa could smell the faint scent of his cologne from his trench coat that was draped over her shoulders.
For a man who lived in such a desolate home with barely any furniture, she felt that it was just like him to take care of her this way. However, she still felt that his face looked quite haggard.
“Eat something. You look like you’ve lost weight.”

EunHa unwrapped KyungHyun’s hamburger and held it out to him. He didn’t accept it and merely stared at her with his arms crossed. She pushed the burger up to his lips. Thinking back to how he had forced the spoon into her mouth when she was bedridden from the gunshot wound, EunHa felt even more determined.
“Here.”

Half of the hamburger disappeared into his mouth in an instant. EunHa watched him slowly chew his food and held up a cola bottle with a straw in it. KyungHyun sucked on the straw, and the bottle immediately became lighter. EunHa hid a smile as she watched him eat his food.
“You’re eating pretty well.”

Feeding this large man was kind of like feeding a dog. She was having fun. EunHa didn’t stop there. She reached over and wiped his mouth once he was done with the hamburger.
“…Did you starve?”



Unaware of the fact that he hadn’t been eating, EunHa merely blinked her eyes at him. It was a good thing she fed him.
“This place is pretty good.”

KyungHyun nonchalantly shrugged his shoulders. EunHa laughed at him in disbelief. EunHa was wearing a hat they had just bought. He reached out and pressed down on the brim, effectively hiding half her face underneath the hat.
“Don’t laugh like that.” “Why not?”
He chucked her under the chin. EunHa looked up at him and laughed. KyungHyun felt his lower half harden. It seemed that the drug Li Kahui had given him hadn’t completely lost its effect on his body just yet.
“Because I want to have sex again. Don’t show such a delicious expression.”
“Wow, just because we’re no longer in Korea, you’re letting go of your filter, aren’t you?”
EunHa looked around at the restaurant filled with young customers as she chatted away.
“People are still going to understand that word, you know.
Don’t you see all these people around us…?”

Her voice faded away as she felt his large hand cover her cheek. His long finger rubbed the area around her mouth softly as he cleaned it. She blushed at his gentle touch as she recalled their heated exchange in the alleyway.
“I know. But I can’t help but see only you in my eyes.”



When she heard him say these words without any embarrassment, her mouth went dry. His finger had now moved on to her lower lip.
“You don’t even listen to me no matter what I say. I wonder why you look so pretty to me.”
“……”

“I can’t take my eyes off of you. I’m afraid you’ll suddenly disappear again.”
He continued to build the tension between them. His sincere tone made her feel uncomfortable. EunHa narrowed her eyes as if she were assessing him.
“Did you take some kind of weird drug?”

She was only joking, but the man who couldn’t take a joke answered back honestly.
“Do I look like I’m high on drugs right now?”

“You keep saying things that are giving me goosebumps.” “I did do drugs. I was given some before I saw you.” “What?”
Was he joking? EunHa frowned.

“I don’t think I’ll be able to sleep for another thirty hours. I think I understand now why the Chinese police are so eager to chase these punks down.”
“Ah.”

Judging from his expression, he was telling the truth. EunHa realized that he wasn’t completely himself right now. No wonder he seemed so strange. She now understood the reason behind the



sudden, animalistic exchange in the alleyway.

“All for the better. Sleep is such a waste of time when I’m with you.”
“Yes, I understand.”

EunHa coughed awkwardly and leaned back. For a man who was high, he seemed completely normal. However, she still found it difficult to hear the words he blurted out. KyungHyun gazed at her and raised an eyebrow.
“If you’re not going to eat, should we head out? I’m staying at a place nearby.”
“No, I’m still hungry.”

She knew that his suggestion of heading out held another meaning because of the way his eyes were caressing her. EunHa reached out and put her hand in the carton of fries. There was something important she needed to tell him right now.





“Kang SungHo is arriving tonight.”

“Good. The transaction is scheduled for tomorrow night, so that’s excellent timing.”
EunHa’s hand stopped moving at KyungHyun’s indifferent reply.

“Tomorrow night?”

“Yeah. There’s no need to drag it out, so I pulled the appointment forward. Im SungJoon will come tomorrow at noon through Hong Kong with the money.”
EunHa’s mouth went dry.

“And?”

“What do you want to do?”

KyungHyun gazed at her as he quietly asked. EunHa blinked. Her long eyelashes fluttered.
“What?”

“Tell me what you plan to do. I’ll match it.”

She could tell from his eyes that he wasn’t lying. EunHa calmed her heart as it began to race inside her chest. She sucked on the straw. The cup of cola that was now only filled with ice.
“I told Kang SungHo that I would steal the drugs once YongSung fulfilled their side of the deal.”



“And?”

KyungHyun asked drily.
“After I meet him at the harbor with the goods…” “You can kill him.”
When EunHa hesitated to finish her sentence, KyungHyun finished it for her in a monotonous tone. EunHa still couldn’t believe that he was being 100% honest with her.
“Do it as you planned, and we will progress as planned.”

KyungHyun spoke as he took her empty cup and placed it on the corner of the tray.
“Tomorrow. After YongSung and drug trafficker Li Kahui are raided by the police at the designated location.”
KyungHyun diagonally dragged her cup from one corner to the other.
“All you need to do is go to the harbor with me. Call Kang SungHo by using the lackey he stuck to you.”
KyungHyun crumpled the hamburger wrapper and tossed it inside the empty cup. After carefully listening to his words, EunHa lifted her eyes from the tray.
“Kang SungHo is extremely observant with things like this. If the police move, there’s a chance Kang SungHo will figure it out and back off.”
“No. Only you and I will go to him.”
“…Are you telling me we’ll be moving without notifying the police?”



KyungHyun took a moment to piercingly stare at her as he faintly smiled.
“What kind of guy am I in your eyes?”

EunHa swallowed. That’s right. This man was undoubtedly a South Korean policeman. At some point, she had lost sight of this.
“Officially, I’d be proceeding with the operation to secretly arrest Kang SungHo.”
“……”

He continued to speak steadily as if to relieve the frustrations deep within EunHa’s heart.
“There is no law that prohibits shooting a criminal if he struggles during his arrest. Well, in this case, you’d be the one pulling the trigger.”
He was telling the truth when he promised he’d let her kill Kang SungHo. But…
“But I’m sure the police aren’t going to be happy about that.”
EunHa looked at him with a serious expression on her face. Lieutenant Han had made sure to tell her before. Their goal was to apprehend Kang SungHo and drag out all the other top-tier members along with him. Because they were police, if the criminal died, things would only get harder.
“What kind of guy am I in your eyes?”

KyungHyun repeated his question once again. His long, narrow eyes glinted dangerously as they gazed at her.
He leaned on the back of the chair and crossed his arms. His



fingers tapped against his arm. Although he was merely waiting for her answer in silence, his sharp eyes had a way of making her feel nervous. EunHa felt as if she was back inside the office in KeumOh instead of being in a foreign country that was five hours away by plane.
It seemed that, although KyungHyun had been a gangster for 12 years, he had never forgotten that he was actually police. Still, whenever he gave her his crooked smile, he looked like a typical bad guy.
EunHa let out a soft laugh. It all didn’t matter. She felt just as nervous as when she was back at the squash courts, waiting for him to finish so that she could approach him. EunHa held KyungHyun’s fierce gaze and whispered.
“…I see a guy who’s just my type.”

EunHa expected him to tell her to stop joking around. But instead, he raised his hand and slowly caressed her cheek. His voice was as soft as his touch as it flowed out of his mouth.
“Thank goodness.”

EunHa had always wondered this. Did this man, who was looking at her so languidly, feel the same way as she did? She wanted to ask him… How did these ‘romantic feelings’ he talked about spring up in such a trashy situation as this?
As soon as they left the fast food restaurant, KyungHyun checked their surroundings and held her to his side as they walked quickly. The night wind was harsh, and the coat on her shoulders flapped wildly. EunHa was adjusting the collar of the trench coat when KyungHyun asked.
“Cold?”

“No.”



Checking a message that came from General Manager Cha, KyungHyun wrapped his arm around her hips and pulled her closer.
“I said I’m not cold.” “Stay still.”
“I’m not a sack that you can just order around. You’re always telling me to stay still.”
EunHa chimed in as she continued to blab on about ridiculous things. Still, she didn’t push him away. KyungHyun rubbed his chin on the top of her head as he scrolled through his cellphone.
EunHa had been correct. Kang SungHo was planning on getting on the flight to Hong Kong tonight. As expected of General Manager Cha, he was going to get on the same plane and follow him here. Everything was going according to plan. After sending the final message regarding the operation to Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha, he lifted his head.
“Do you smell the sea?”

The slightly salty fragrance of the sea was carried by the wind.
EunHa drew in a deep breath.

“Good catch. There’s a port nearby. 10 minutes away by car.”
“Ah, that explains it.”

The fast food restaurant was not on the main street and was located in the middle of an industrial zone, so she thought it was a little weird. Commercial businesses had sprung up in these industrial zones of cities because they were usually filled with people who did business here. This was especially true in Shenzhen. Because of the vast amount of containers located here, the ports were generally used by international companies. Therefore, this area was filled with



people.

“Don’t you think there’s a hotel somewhere nearby?”

As soon as they exited the area filled with factories, they came across a gas station on a two-lane road. Walking side-by-side, KyungHyun raised his bleary eyes.
“Are you asking me to go to a hotel with you?”

“No. What are you talking about? You said you were staying somewhere around here.”
KyungHyun wondered if he had taken any Viagra as he quickly crossed the road with EunHa, who was basically jumping up and down. Thanks to the bright lights of the 24-hour gas station, the street was illuminated. However, there weren’t a lot of cars on the road. Most of the vehicles were large trailer trucks that were headed for the port.
“I’m not staying at a hotel…”

He saw a taxi approaching them from far away. KyungHyun waved his hand to flag it down. They needed to get to somewhere safe as soon as possible. Up until yesterday, no one was tailing them, but because they were currently in a foreign country, they couldn’t be too careful. The taxi slowed to a stop and parked in front of them.
“Let’s get in for now.”
KyungHyun wrapped his arm around EunHa’s hips when… Vrrrr. The cellphone inside his pant pocket began to vibrate. The caller was Lieutenant Han. She usually didn’t call him on his personal cellphone…
“What’s going on?”

Click.



KyungHyun answered the cellphone as he opened the backdoor of the car. In that moment, KyungHyun’s thick brows twisted.
– I’m sorry, Sunbae-nim. There was something urgent I needed to report…
The backseat of the taxi was full of men. Someone stuck their head out and grinned at them.
“Ni hao, Director Shin.”

Slam!

KyungHyun almost broke the door as he slammed it shut. EunHa looked confused. He gave her back a hard push as he hissed something through his clenched teeth.
“Run.”

EunHa quickly caught on. After she saw the urgent gleam in his eyes, she hesitated for a moment, but then she quickly began to run across the two-lane street. She heard the car door open and close behind her. Then she heard fists hitting flesh and men’s voices as they cursed and groaned.
Frowning, EunHa panted for breath as she ran for her life. As she ran, she turned around to take a look. She saw KyungHyun fighting two other men.
“Haa, haa…!”
What should I do…? What do I do?!
EunHa continued to pant as her brows furrowed even more. They were currently in an industrial zone. She was basically running in the nude, and it would only get her so far. EunHa changed directions and began to head for the brightly-lit gas station. She saw the driver of an 8-ton truck get out as if he were in a hurry to go to the bathroom.



[What… What the…?]
The man saw a woman running across the street with her hair flying behind her. He stared at her with wide eyes.
“I’m going to borrow your car for just a minute, Oppa.”

EunHa agilely jumped up into the driver’s seat that was higher than her height. The car’s engine was off, but the key was still in the ignition. EunHa didn’t hesitate and started the engine.
Rumble. The seat shook as the truck’s engine turned on.
[Hey, what are you…!]

Realizing that his truck was about to be stolen, the man rushed over to the driver side door and flung it open.
“Uh, uh… watch out behind you!”

The driver whipped his head around at her warning, and EunHa quickly pushed his chest and caused him to fall back. Then she changed the gear of the truck and stomped down on the accelerator pedal. The truck shot out of the gas station like a bullet as she kept her eyes on the taxi behind her as well as the men who were attacking KyungHyun through the rearview mirror.
‘What’s going on…?’

EunHa’s brow furrowed. She had no idea who these men were. Although her mind was muddled, she didn’t have any time to sort through her thoughts. All she knew was that this group of men didn’t have good intentions toward KyungHyun.
“Ugh!”

KyungHyun flipped over a man who was approaching him from the back. Through the back window, EunHa could see the large man roll



on the asphalt. Gripping the steering wheel, EunHa’s eyes focused on the back mirror.
Someone grabbed on to KyungHyun from the back. KyungHyun’s movements were now restrained, but, as the man brandished a knife, he managed to hit the man’s wrist. Then he grabbed the man’s arm that was around his neck and twisted it.
EunHa bit her lips nervously. Then she saw the man on the ground begin to slowly crawl with a knife in his hand. Struggling in a bloody battle with the other large man, KyungHyun didn’t seem to notice.
Oh no.

Her eyes widened. She felt her heart jump to her throat. She didn’t have time to think. She clenched her teeth and turned the steering wheel as far as it would go without slowing down.
Screeech!

The large truck made a U-turn as it skidded on the narrow road. EunHa’s body was thrust to the side, but she didn’t think anything of it as she slammed her hand down on the center of the wheel.
Beeeep!!!

The truck’s horn pierced through the air as the truck raced down the road. The man who had been approaching KyungHyun with a knife saw the bright headlights of the truck and jumped in the opposite direction in surprise. The shock only lasted a second. KyungHyun thought she had escaped, but when he saw her come back, he grimaced and roared out in a loud voice.
“Go back! Don’t come here!”

She couldn’t do that. EunHa watched as he waved at her and shook her head. EunHa’s body was moving by instinct, not by reason. The terrified EunHa who had barely taken a breath during the deaths



of her parents was no longer here.

“I came here to save you, so show me how deeply moved you are, Mr. Macho lover.”
EunHa muttered under her breath. Unlike her eyes full of emotion, KyungHyun’s face held a terrible expression as he ordered her to turn the car around. She would never be able to leave him here and run off on her own. It wasn’t because she was paying him back for saving her life many times before. The moment she saw the man approach KyungHyun with a knife, she almost lost it.
“How dare that bastard… Who does he think he’s…”

Screech!

The 8-ton truck sped towards the taxi as if it was going to crash into it. However, it barely managed to stop right in front of it. EunHa stretched out her body and opened the passenger-side door. She yelled out to KyungHyun.
“Get in!”
“Damn it, what are you…!”

A man began to run towards the truck. KyungHyun kicked him down. Another man took out his gun. KyungHyun saw this and snapped his wrist before hitting the man’s head with the butt of the gun.
Bang!

The man’s finger was trapped and pressed on the trigger. The gunshot rang in the air. KyungHyun clenched his teeth. It would only be a matter of time before the police got here.
“Hurry, get in!”



KyungHyun ran towards the open passenger-side door and jumped inside. Suddenly, EunHa felt something touch her cheek. She couldn’t help but hold her breath. Her heart raced nervously inside her chest.
“…Don’t move, Lee EunHa.”

She didn’t have to see KyungHyun’s twisted expression to know that something had gone terribly wrong. The truck’s engine turned off, and the key was pulled out of the ignition.
Damn it.

She was just about to hit the person with her elbow, but he was faster. Her shoulder was pressed back onto the seat of the truck and the blade of a knife was pressed against her cheek.
“Oho, we can’t have such a pretty face be ruined by a scar, now can we? There, there.”
“Ugh…”

Someone forced EunHa’s head to turn. The greasy face of an unfamiliar man entered her eyes. She could tell at first glance that this man was a gangster.
“Hey, are you sure this fucking bitch is that fucking bitch?”

The man was standing on the step underneath the door as he yelled out. One of the men that had taken a blow from KyungHyun held his stomach as he rushed over.
“Yes, Hyung-nim. I’m sure that’s her.”

EunHa raised her eyes and glared at the man in front of her. The man continued to press his knife against her as his mouth stretched into a grin, his teeth gleaming.
“Wow, lookit this bitch’s face. I can see why this face



caused Director Shin’s head to turn. Baby, let’s see… Is she as good in bed as she looks?”
EunHa’s brow furrowed as her eyes became fierce. The man acted surprised and widened his eyes before winking back at her.
“Aigoo, how scary. She must have a sharp temper. Why doesn’t our baby over here introduce herself. How old are you?”
“Get lost, you thug bastard.”

EunHa’s mouth twisted as she spit out the words. The man boomed out in laughter.
“Shall I go first, then? This cool oppa’s name is Im SungJoon. My hobby is beatin’ bitches into submission. I’ve found that bitches like you turn mighty gentle once they see some blood.”
His voice became strange at the end. His mouth was smiling, but his eyes weren’t. His eyes looked like that of a man who was constantly craving violence to appease his addiction. EunHa knew these eyes very well. EunHa did her best to settle her uneven breaths.
“Get your hands off her.”

KyungHyun looked at Im SungJoon and hissed out the words through his clenched teeth. Im SungJoon’s cruelty was well-known within YongSung. He didn’t go easy on women either. Im SungJoon’s tongue ran over his lips as he laughed at KyungHyun.
“I believe our dear Director Shin isn’t in any position to be barkin’ out any orders.”
Im SungJoon’s two wives had died by his hands. One of them was even pregnant with their child. To him, women were merely



playthings that could always be replaced. KyungHyun needed to turn his attentions away from EunHa and back on him.
“If you let her go, I’ll do whatever you want.”

“Haha. How stupid. Of course I’m goin’ to do whatever I want… From now on.”
Im SungJoon looked at KyungHyun with an excited expression on his face. He burst out laughing.
“Didn’t you say you killed her?”

KyungHyun’s dark eyebrows twitched. He was still aware that he had not ended the call from earlier, and his cellphone was now in his pocket. Even if Lieutenant Han was listening in on this conversation, she wouldn’t be able to help him out of this situation right now.
“Hello? You told me that the brave woman who dared to brandish a gun at our boss died by your hands. Then who’s this? A corpse? When she’s still panting for breath over here? Can you not see her with your own eyes? Is somethin’ wrong with yer eyes?”
KyungHyun’s fierce eyes moved to EunHa, whose head was tightly captured by Im SungJoon. There wasn’t much time for him to make a decision. He needed to kill Im SungJoon. It was now or never. KyungHyun silently took a few deep breaths and met EunHa’s eyes.
Please. Don’t move, EunHa.

“Yer done for, you traitor sunuvabitch.”

KyungHyun pulled out his gun at the grinning Im SungJoon. At that moment, EunHa’s eyes widened as she stared at something behind him.
“No!”



Thud. A dull pain exploded inside KyungHyun’s head. His eyelids lowered, and he saw EunHa’s shocked expression as she let out a scream.
Damn it.

Warm blood trickled down from his forehead. KyungHyun was plunged into darkness.





Im SungJoon and his men shoved them into a car and dragged them off to somewhere nearby. For now, EunHa was just glad that KyungHyun hadn’t stopped breathing.
Seeing how Im SungJoon had yelled at the lackey who had struck KyungHyun on the head, it didn’t seem like he wanted KyungHyun dead just yet.
You just need to get your head on straight. EunHa, get yourself together.
EunHa chewed on the inside of her cheek. Being a member of Serim, EunHa had encountered dangerous situations countless times before. But she wasn’t stupid. She knew that the current situation was one of the most dangerous situations she’d ever been in. However, she couldn’t merely tremble in fear and await her death. EunHa desperately tried to think of something.
“Move quickly. Quickly!”

The hand that pushed her back was rough. She heard a mixture of Korean and Chinese. The voices echoed, so she guessed that they were in a big building. She heard the sound of large machinery as well as the sound of running water. She also smelled something pungent. EunHa frowned.
‘Just where are we?’

Once they had arrived at this secluded location, her blindfold was taken off. She opened her eyes and could finally see the source of the foul stench. This place was a chemical fertilizer factory. The air was filled with the sound of conveyer belts, and a pile of packages



with a logo stamped on them was stacked against a corner of the room. While the whole room was rinsed down with water, the stench of the fertilizer could not be washed away.
“What are you looking around for?!”

Once they passed through the production facility, they arrived at an iron door. When the door opened, EunHa could smell the characteristically musty and moldy smell of a basement. She was pushed down the steps as she tried to clear her head.
Clank.

The basement was filled with rooms that looked like bunkers. A door to one of these rooms opened. One of the men forced her into a chair and tied her down. Another man dragged someone else inside and threw them on the floor as if they were a sack of potatoes.
KyungHyun, whose eyes were blindfolded and whose hands were tied behind his back, twitched on the ground. EunHa watched him and bit the inside of her mouth. A white cloth was wound around his head after he had been hit with the wooden beam. However, she could clearly see the red blood seeping through the fabric.
“Mm…”

Even though she was trying her best to remain calm, seeing KyungHyun again made her chin tremble. EunHa regained her composure and clenched her jaw.
The Chinese men stepped away and watched them. One of them answered their phone and quickly left the room. Then the man who had raised a knife to her began to dust off his white suit as he entered the room, mumbling to himself.
“Ah, fuck. It smells like fuckin’ ass in here. It literally smells like shit.”



EunHa tightly closed her eyes and began to sort through her tangled thoughts. The man who had attacked them after they exited the fast food restaurant introduced himself as Im SungJoon. If he was truly the Im SungJoon from YongSung that she had heard about, then he had a cat-and-dog relationship with KyungHyun.
But KyungHyun had definitely said that Im SungJoon was going to arrive tomorrow with the money from Hong Kong, didn’t he? If two people on the same team had different plans, it could only mean one thing.
Just like how Shin KyungHyun had laid a trap for Im SungJoon, Im SungJoon had secretly followed KyungHyun in order to deal his final blow.
‘Then what is this place?’

Even though he could have killed them immediately, Im SungJoon had dragged them here instead. He had figured out that she was the one who had shot Noh HyungChul and that KyungHyun had lied about killing her. He had more than enough reason to kill them.
“Hyung-nim, he’s arrived.”

“He’s the ones who called us here, and he’s the one who’s late? Fuck.”
“It seems that it’s because they take their security very seriously. It looks like they wanted to check out the situation before coming.”
“Well, the scene has been set. Now all that’s left is to start the show, right?”
Im SungJoon tapped KyungHyun’s body with his foot. With his hands tied behind his back, KyungHyun slightly lifted his head. Unlike EunHa, he still had his blindfold on. EunHa, who as sitting about 5 meters away from him, bit her lip.



“Aigoo, hello there.”

The door opened once again, and an unfamiliar man entered the room. Im SungJoon bowed to the young man who was slowly walking over to them.
[Do all Koreans change plans as they wish?] “What’d he say? Translate.”
“He seems a bit irked because he’s been called earlier than scheduled.”
The translator whispered to Im SungJoon. Im SungJoon pursed his lips and spit out his reply in a low voice.
“As you can see, there have been other urgent matters at hand. Tell him that.”
With a cigarette between his leather gloved fingers, Li Kahui gazed down at KyungHyun’s body on the floor and then at EunHa tied to the chair.
[Explain this urgent matter to me.]

As he muttered in Chinese, Im SungJoon’s lackey translated.

“We learned that there has been a little problem with Director Shin, which is why he pulled the schedule forward. So we had no choice but to change the plan last minute. Tell him.”
Im SungJoon grinned as his words were translated over to Li Kahui.
Li Kahui took a drag of his cigarette and let out a deep breath.
[And this problem is…?]

“I’ve always had a hunch that this fuckin’ bastard was shady. He was secretly sleepin’ with an enemy spy and



probably planned to steal the drugs once the business transaction was completed. It’s pretty obvious, don’t ‘cha think? If I didn’t do anythin’ about this, then our first meeting would have ended with many misunderstandings, right? That’s why I kindly brought him to you alive… So that you can see it with your own eyes. The greater the business deal, the more certain you have to be, am I right?”
Im SungJoon’s words laced with curses and a country accent was translated concisely as he handed over a tablet to Li Kahui. The screen showed a picture of EunHa at the YongSung founding party. Li Kahui saw the room full of bullet holes behind her and took a deep drag of his cigarette.
[…It seems that you have been pricked by the rose’s thorns.]
He looked over at KyungHyun’s limp body on the floor and muttered. The translator was at a loss.
“Hey, what did that punk say just now?”

Im SungJoon poked his translator as he asked, but the translator didn’t fully understand what Li Kahui was talking about and looked embarrassed.
“I’m not sure…”

Im SungJoon had the urge to smack his lackey on the back of his head but held back. Instead, he elegantly held his hands together and grinned at Li Kahui like a crocodile.
“Thankfully, you listened to me, so I was able to solve this problem. I told you that this punk was a nasty fellow and asked you to keep tabs on him. You kept your eye on him very well.”
Li Kahui didn’t reply and merely asked him a question with a blank



expression on his face.

[So have you prepared the money?]

“Hyung-nim, he’s asking if you’ve prepared the money.”

Im SungJoon swallowed back the curses that were ready to leave his lips. This Chinese guy didn’t let him change the tone into something more elegant and immediately began talking about money. He looked at Li Kahui with a mischievous smile and spoke.
“The money will be arriving tomorrow from Hong Kong. No matter what country we’re in, it takes time to launder money. Especially if it’s dirty money. And the amount of money we’re moving around isn’t a penny or two, so…”
Li Kahui listened to the translator with a blank expression. He flicked his finished cigarette onto the floor. Then he pulled out a gun from inside his coat pocket.
“What the fuck?!”

Im SungJoon shouted out in shock. His lackeys became alert and looked like they were ready to attack. The air inside the room became tense in an instant.
“So you made all this fuss when we weren’t even going to be doing business and called me out at this hour. The only reason you’d do that is because of this, isn’t it?]
Li Kahui pointed his gun down at KyungHyun, who was still blindfolded and gagged. Im SungJoon drew in a deep breath. Even if this man was known to make high quality drugs, Im SungJoon couldn’t believe Shin KyungHyun had decided to do business with such a nasty man.
[Wait, don’t shoot!]



EunHa shouted out to Li Kahui, who had his gun pointed at KyungHyun. Li Kahui whipped his head around and looked at her. Her perfect English caught his interest. He could now understand why the Egoist had hired her without doing a thorough background check on her. She was quite beautiful.
[I have something I’d like to tell you.]

Li Kahui began to walk over to her. Im SungJoon poked his lackey.

“Hey, what’s that fuckin’ bitch sayin’?”
“That is… It’s in English, so I don’t really know…”

“Ey, you useless piece of shit. You don’t know English?”

Im SungJoon whispered and couldn’t help but hit his lackey in the back of the head. When they heard the thwack, Li Kahui’s lackeys all shifted their dark gazes and glared at him. Im SungJoon wanted to go over there and gag the woman’s mouth, but he couldn’t. Instead, he stepped back and frowned as more curses flew out of his mouth.
“Fuck… seriously…”

KyungHyun heard her voice and turned his head to hear her better. EunHa saw this and drew in a silent breath. She wanted to exchange a look with him, but his eyes were hidden. She had no way of sending him any signals. Li Kahui blocked him from her view as he slowly approached her.
[What do you have to say?]

The dice was now basically in her hands. Her heart raced like crazy. EunHa looked Li Kahui straight in his eyes and opened her mouth.
[That man did plan on stealing the drugs. But he was planning on returning it straight back to you.]



Li Kahui’s thin lips went up as he looked at her with much interest.

[Why?]

[He told me your drugs are of the highest quality. The leader of YongSung is basically fighting for his life right now. Because there are limits within that organization, he said that he wanted to play in the big pond now.]
KyungHyun silently listened to what she said. However, when he heard the metallic sound of Li Kahui’s gun, he was worried that the gun was now pointed at EunHa. His heart began to race inside his chest.
[And how can I trust that you’re telling the truth?] [That’s not up to me to decide.]
EunHa’s mouth went dry as she concocted this story. But judging from how Im SungJoon acted subservient to this Chinese man, this man was the one who held the power. If this man was always seeking profits, this attempt wouldn’t be in vain. EunHa did her best to hide her anxiety and looked at the drug lord with clear eyes.
[Then do you want to make a deal with me?]

Li Kahui lowered his head and spoke softly so that others wouldn’t hear. EunHa felt his breath against her cheek. His narrow eyes gazed at her as they filled with desire. His intention was clear.
Ah, so he’s like that. Then things might be a lot easier than she thought.
[I’ll do it.]

Realizing where his interests lied, EunHa didn’t hesitate and nodded.



[Aren’t you going to hear the conditions first?]

[It doesn’t matter. All I need to do is give you my terms.]

EunHa sharply raised her eyes as she tried to suppress the tremors.
[What do you want?] [Save that man.]
[It doesn’t seem like he’ll live just because I don’t kill him myself.]
Li Kahui unhappily glanced at Im SungJoon, who was currently doing his best to suppress his curses. Then he looked back down at EunHa.
[I just don’t want to seem him die a dog’s death in front of me. Those are my terms.]
What they needed the most right now was time. They had to escape this dangerous situation as soon as possible.
[If you do me this favor, I’ll do whatever you want.]

As their whispered conversation came to an end, Li Kahui turned around with a strange expression on his face. Then he began to approach KyungHyun, who was still lying on the floor with his arms and legs bound. He crouched down onto the floor and removed KyungHyun’s blindfold and gag. KyungHyun frowned as his eyes adjusted to the light.
The first thing that entered his blurry vision was EunHa, who was still tied to the chair. His hands, which were still tied behind his back, tightened into fists. KyungHyun turned to Li Kahui, who was crouched over him, and muttered.



[This is business between men. There is no need for a woman’s presence, is there?]
For a man who was tied down, KyungHyun’s voice sounded extremely calm and steady. A strange gleam flashed in his deep, dark eyes. Li Kahui stared at his terrifying expression and slightly pulled back. To be honest, he had thought about killing them off for creating such an annoying situation. However, it looked like things were just about to get interesting.
[Is that so? Then should I just get rid of her?]

Li Kahui pointed his gun at EunHa. EunHa flinched and clenched her teeth, but her chin began to tremble once again.
[Don’t do anything you’ll regret.]

KyungHyun’s gloomy voice was so cold that it brought goosebumps.
[If you shoot her, I’ll kill you.]

Li Kahui looked back and forth between KyungHyun and EunHa as his lips formed a crooked smile. If anyone else had threatened him while their limbs were bound, he would have just snorted. However, something about KyungHyun made him hesitate.
Even if what the woman had said was true and KyungHyun had planned on stealing the drugs back for him, KyunHyun was too dangerous a man to keep by his side. Li Kahui could understand why KyungHyun’s colleagues were so desperate to catch and kill him.
[As much as I want to see you try and kill me in your state right now, it would be a waste for me to pluck this ﬂower right now.]
Honestly, it would be a waste to kill KyungHyun’s woman just like this. Once the business deal was completed, he’d take this woman as



part of the deal. Shin KyungHyun, who was currently waiting on bated breath, would be turned over to Im SungJoon, who was watching them with rapt attention. This was definitely a possibility.
[In light of our friendship, I’ll give you one final night with her, Director Shin.]
[Don’t lay a hand on her.]

Dark fireworks were exploding behind KyungHyun’s eyes.

[This marks the end of our friendship.]

Li Kahui gave his gun to one of his lackeys and smacked his lips as he got up. He gestured to his men and one of the Chinese men rushed over to his side. At his command, the man took out a rectangular briefcase. When the case opened, there were various medicine bottles inside. He took one out.
“……!”

As soon as he began to walk towards EunHa, KyungHyun’s face twisted. A hoarse shout tore from his lips.
“No!”

EunHa’s face was filled with terror as she watched the Chinese man approach her with a syringe. Having figured out what was going on, EunHa let out a weak cry through her clenched teeth.
“Stop… I said stop… Ugh…!”

She felt a prick as the syringe pierced her arm. KyungHyun cried out as he began to squirm his way towards her. As soon as Im SungJoon saw this, he went over and stomped down on KyungHyun’s abdomen with his foot.
“Shut yer mouth.”



As the drug entered her system, it felt as if icy water was flowing through her veins and spreading throughout her body. EunHa struggled, but she was still tied down to the chair, so it was pointless.
[What was that?! What did you give her?!]

Li Kahui watched KyungHyun scream from the floor and shrugged.

[A drug that makes one want to die?] [What?]
[This is punishment for trying to make a joke out of me.]

Nine out of ten would begin to have hallucinations once they took this drug. The drug would take over one’s subconscious mind and show powerful images of the things they didn’t want to see.
Last night, he had given KyungHyun the same kind of drug. Even after snorting this drug, KyungHyun had shown no reaction. Li Kahui’s pride had taken a small blow, but who knew that he’d be able to redeem himself like this?
[Don’t worry. I didn’t give her a lethal dose. It’s just a bit insufferable in the beginning, that’s all.]
The intravenous drug was incredibly strong. EunHa’s whole body went cold and she began to tremble. The chair began to rattle on the floor.
“Uh… Uugh…”

EunHa’s body doubled over. Her neck was stretched taut as her veins bulged through the fair skin. The same went for her pale face. Her face turned red, almost as if it was going to burst.
“Lee EunHa!!”

Her name tore out of KyungHyun’s lips. Im SungJoon frowned as he



watched EunHa have a seizure. If it were up to him, he would have just shot that woman dead instead of seeing such a disgusting sight. But that Chinese bastard was truly extraordinary. He looked as if he were listening to some entertaining music as he watched the woman suffer. The laughing Li Kahui checked his watch before looking up at Im SungJoon.
[I’ll give you three hours? No, I’ll give you two hours.]

The translator hurriedly relayed this message to Im SungJoon. Im SungJoon frowned as he looked back at him with doubt.
[Come back here with the money if you want the goods.]

Im SungJoon didn’t even have a chance to reply. It was currently a little past two in the morning right now. It would still be the middle of the night in two hours. Li Kahui looked at Im SungJoon as if he were waiting for his response.
“…Fine.”

Im SungJoon barely got the word out. His face looked like he had just chewed on something disgusting.
[I’ll watch over these two until our business deal is completed.]
“Tell him I understand.”

Im SungJoon felt that taking Shin KyungHyun with him would only serve to be a nuisance anyway. Li Kahui’s men beat KyungHyun as he screamed. Then they took him and the delirious EunHa out of the room.
“Let’s go.”

Im SungJoon spit on the floor and checked his watch. He needed to call his broker in Hong Kong, who was on standby and waiting for his



order, and tell him to get his ass over here as soon as possible. He also needed to report what had happened to Noh HyungChul, who was still recovering in the hospital. There was a lot to do.
His hurried footsteps became even faster. However, two of Li Kahui’s biggest henchmen blocked their exit. Feeling that something had gone terribly wrong, Im SungJoon’s brow furrowed.
“What’s going on with these bastards?”

Li Kahui, who had been turning the doorknob to leave the room, stopped and turned his head around.
[Ah, you can’t leave until our business deal is completed. I forgot to tell you.]
“You told me to come back with the money.”

You fuckin’ bastard. Im SungJoon wanted to curse out at him, but he swallowed it back down. He was trembling with rage as his lips stretched into a smile.
[Even though we’re in the middle of a city, do you know how I’ve managed to avoid the police?]
Most drugs were produced in remote locations due the resulting smell and the manufacturing process.
[An extremely thorough security.]

However, Li Kahui had established this 3-story, 2-basement building in the heart of the industrial zone, which was high in sewage and pollution. Like this, he managed to avoid the eyes of the police. By creating a pharmaceutical company as a front for purchasing all their supplies, they produced the Philopon in their factory.
[You may enter as you wish, but you cannot leave as freely. One thing that’s nice about a fertilizer factory is that you can



dispose of bodies without raising any suspicions. We can just make human fertilizers.]
His smiling face looked like a madman’s.

[So I ask for your understanding until our deal is over.]

After he was done speaking, Li Kahui took out a piece of gum and popped it into his mouth. Then he walked away and disappeared. Only half of the men he had dragged inside was now left.
“Fuck…”

It was his mistake. He shouldn’t have underestimated the man with whom Shin KyungHyun had chosen to do business. He had only wanted to solve the problem of potential thieves that wanted to steal the drugs, but now he felt all the hairs on his body stand on end.
If he didn’t have the money in time, there was a chance that he wouldn’t get out of here alive.
Im SungJoon held back the curses that threatened to burst out of his throat and quickly took out his cellphone. His forehead was drenched in cold sweat.






“Huu…”

Eunha trembled on the cold cement floor as if she was freezing. The drug’s effect was definitely taking hold of her body as it spread through her veins. KyungHyun grasped both of her arms as he softly whispered.
“Get ahold of yourself, Lee EunHa.”

They were currently locked up in a room one floor below the room where EunHa had been given the drug. The room looked like a dreary prison cell with no light. Beyond the steel bars, they could see two of Li Kahui’s men playing mahjong at a table as they smoked their cigarettes.
“Haa… Huu…”

He had already managed to untie the restraints around his hands and feet. It wasn’t that KyungHyun couldn’t take down the men outside and escape this place. The problem lied with EunHa, who hadn’t been able to wake up from the effects of the drug.
“S… Save… me.”

Her teeth chattered as she muttered. EunHa’s eyes were unfocused as she gazed at him. KyungHyun couldn’t endure the pang of regret and a curse burst out of his lips.
“Damn it…”



“S…Save me, please… Please… D…Don’t kill me!!”
EunHa rubbed her trembling hands together as she begged. Not even aware that her thighs were rubbing against the floor, she backed away from him, her eyes full of terror.
“M…Mom… Mom, save me. Dad… Dad… Ugh… Uuugh…”

Her pale cheeks were covered in dirt as fat tears dripped down. KyungHyun recalled what Li Kahui had told him earlier. There was no doubt that EunHa was currently reliving one of the most difficult memories in her life. KyungHyun clenched his teeth and approached her.
“You’re hallucinating, EunHa. Lee EunHa!”

He whispered through his clenched teeth, but EunHa’s eyes didn’t see him. Her gleaming eyes were only filled with fear. It was as if she had returned to her trembling sixteen-year-old self who had just escaped her house.
“I’m sorry!!!”

Just as KyungHyun was about to embrace her, EunHa began to struggle frantically against him.
“Let me go! Let go!!”
“It’s all a dream. A hallucination. It’s not real. EunHa…!”

KyungHyun spit out bitterly as she raised her hands and began to scratch him like a wild animal, causing him to pull her away from him. She was panting for breath. She could go into cardiac arrest at any moment. KyungHyun clenched his teeth until he felt pain as he fiercely shook her shoulders.
“Get ahold of yourself, Lee EunHa… Lee EunHa!!”



He slapped her cheeks as he tried to meet her eyes. Just as EunHa seemed to take in a deep breath, her eyes seemed to grow even more helpless. A thin voice flowed out of her trembling lips.
“You can hit me. If you want to hit me, you can hit me, so… Ahjussi…”
KyungHyun froze. EunHa licked her dry lips. Her body trembled like a leaf.
“Please give me some water, Ahjussi. I think I’m going to die. Please, I’m begging you.”
KyungHyun’s frown twisted even deeper. Her face was drenched in tears as a sixteen-year-old Lee EunHa began to plead.
“I can’t even pee anymore, so there’s nothing left to drink… So please…”
KyungHyun almost couldn’t believe what he was hearing. His breaths became rougher. EunHa continued to speak in a pitiful voice.
“I won’t say something like that ever again. I won’t ask you to send me back to Korea again, so… Please give me something to drink…”
“…EunHa.”

KyungHyun’s voice cracked as he called her name. However, his voice didn’t reach EunHa as she continued to suffer within her memories.
“You can hit me. I’ll do anything… anything you ask… So… Please, don’t leave me here… It’s too dark and scary… I’m hungry… I’m so thirsty… Huu… Ahjussi… Please… Please save me… Ugh…”
Unable to endure it any longer, KyungHyun fiercely bit the inside of



his cheek as he brought her to his chest in a tight embrace. His chest rose and fell with his rough breaths. Now in his arms, EunHa began to speak in a thin voice that sounded like a tired bird.
“If you want to sleep with me… you can, so…” “Haa…”
A raw groan burst out of KyungHyun’s lips. He could only hug her even tighter. There was nothing else he could do to help her. He felt disgusted and ashamed at his helplessness.
“I’m a rag.”

EunHa spoke with no emotion. At these unexpected words, KyungHyun’s brows twisted. She sounded as if she had given up on everything. This helpless voice rang in his ears.
“I’m a dirty whore.” “EunHa…”
His arms around EunHa began to loosen on its own. With a trembling hand, KyungHyun grasped her cheek. A single tear escaped his twisted eyes.
“If I leave this place, there’s nothing I can do.”

EunHa’s unfocused eyes looked far into the distance as she mumbled.
“I’m a useless bitch, so no one will take me.”

She was repeating the words that someone had commanded her to say. Someone had ordered her to repeat these words so that they could clip her wings at an early age and break her will.
“If I leave the organization, I’m a traitor. Traitors will be killed. There are no exceptions.”



KyungHyun had heard something similar from SungHo when he first entered Serim. He brought her back into his embrace and roared out.
“EunHa…!”

[Hey, you son of a bitch, shut up!!]

One of the men on the other side of the iron bars shouted out at them in Chinese. Because they had been ordered to stay out of the prison cell, the man took a long wooden stick that had been embedded with protuding nails and fiercely dug it into KyungHyun’s back.
“Uugh!!”

As a pained groan left his mouth, EunHa’s eyes suddenly met his. It seemed as if she was returning to her senses.
“Are you okay…?” “EunHa.”
KyungHyun called her name with a pained face. Still in a crouched position, EunHa held out her slender hand.
“Don’t make a sound. Or else you’ll die. Be good.”

What was EunHa seeing now? A tear rolled down KyungHyun’s face. However, he wasn’t aware of it because of the petrifying pain.
“You must be hungry too. Here… But don’t bite it too much, or else it will hurt… So only a little… Just a little bit…”
She gave him a sweet smile as she held out her finger to him. Watching her, KyungHyun burned with regret. He should have killed Kang SungHo when he had the chance.
“EunHa…”



Maybe if he bit her finger hard enough to draw blood, she’d return to her senses.
“Haa…”

KyungHyun could not put his thoughts into action. The person in front of him was not the strong, bold Lee EunHa that he knew. This was the young EunHa of 10 years ago who had to endure the pain and violence all on her own.
“After enduring it all for 10 years, you can’t even wait the small amount of time it takes to lay a trap?” “…What do you know? How dare you talk back? Do you even know what I did these past 10 years?”
He recalled the way she had screamed at him. She was right. He should have kept his mouth shut back then.
“If you haven’t seen it with your own eyes, you don’t have a right to say you know.” “I fully understand. When I joined the criminal organization, I had to do many dirty things as well.”
Instead of telling her that he understood her pain so thoughtlessly, he should have just brought Kang SungHo to her alive and given her the knife.
“Haa…”

If only he had done that. Then he wouldn’t have had to see the woman he loved endure such pain in front of his eyes.
“Don’t cry.”

EunHa whispered in soft voice as she looked at him with her large, wet eyes.
Drip.



Despite her own words, her own tears continued to drench her small face. EunHa lied down on her side and gently embraced him. Tap, tap. She began to pat him on the back as she mumbled.
“Don’t cry, EunHa.”

EunHa whispered softly as she tried to console herself. KyungHyun felt that putting a gun to his own head would have been better than this. He was now being given a glimpse of the unknown history she had tried to keep hidden away. His whole body was shaking in pain. The thing that drove him insane was the fact that even after having gone through all this, she was still able to joke around and laugh.
“This is like a movie. It’s not real.”

EunHa softly murmured. KyungHyun heard this and began to bite the inside of his cheek even harder. He was just grateful that this young girl hadn’t completely lost her sanity. KyungHyun whispered to her.
“Yeah. This is all a dream.”

Feeling limp from the shock, KyungHyun mustered the last of his strength and hugged her back. He held her to his chest and repeated the same words over and over again. Whether she could hear him or not, EunHa’s convulsions didn’t stop.
It was completely dark. The old storage room of the flat was filled with the smell of urine.
Click.

When she heard the door open, EunHa lifted her head from between her knees.
“Please save me. Ahjussi, please give me some water…!
Please…!”



The man frowned at the stench.

“Seeing as you still have enough strength to shout, I think we’re far from finished.”
No way.

She felt like she’d die if she had to stay locked up in here any longer. She’d rather be hit instead. It would be better than starving to death in this suffocating darkness.
“You can hit me. If you want to hit me, you can hit me, so… Ahjussi.”
Her tears flowed as she mumbled. As if he had been waiting for this, the man’s large hand grabbed her throat and dragged her outside. He began to beat her. She couldn’t even close her eyes. SungHo wouldn’t forgive her if she was hit on the cheek and fell onto the ground. When she got up and looked at him, he rubbed her cheek as if to tell her she did a good job. Then he grabbed her hair.
“Do you know what you did wrong?” “I won’t say something like that ever again. I won’t ask you to send me back to Korea again, so…”
SungHo had confined her immediately after she told him she’d return to Korea and join YongSung. Despite what he had promised her after having been appointed the new leader of Serim, it didn’t seem like he was interested in capturing YongSung’s boss. Frustrated, EunHa told him to send her back to Korea so that she could fulfill her revenge on her own. In the end, this was the result.
“I think I’m going to die of thirst. Please give me something to drink…”
SungHo began to hand her a chipped cup. He poured out the water. The tap water smelled like disinfectant, but EunHa hastily held out her hands and drank the water. However, her thirst didn’t go



away.
“You can hit me. I’ll do anything… anything you ask… So… Please, don’t leave me here…”
The room had no windows, and not a single ray of light entered inside. It was too dark and scary. She didn’t know how many days she had gone without food, how long she had been locked inside. Two days, no, three days? Either way, it didn’t matter. If SungHo decided to leave now, she didn’t know when he’d return to this apartment.
“You’ll do anything I ask? You should have done so from the start. But what can you do?”
SungHo looked at her with gleaming eyes. Eunha shivered before opening her dry lips.
“If you want to sleep with me… you can, so…”

Even in this hellish situation, his body reacted without fail. After taking one look at the bulge in his pants, Eunha blurted out the first thing that popped into her head. Even though she said it with her own lips, something lurched in her chest and a cry burst out.
SungHo frowned and looked at her with disdain. Then his lips stretched into a smile.
“Rag bitch.”

Drip.

“You sure are good at offering your dirty body.”

EunHa’s tears flowed down as they drenched her face. She hadn’t drunk anything, so she didn’t think she could even urinate. She thought she had already cried out all the tears she had, but it seemed that hope had stabbed her in the back once again.



“Repeat after me. You are a rag.” “…I’m a rag.”
SungHo bit his cigarette and clicked his lighter.

“Do you know what it means to be a rag? You stupid girl. It means you’re a whore. It’s what we call bitches like you who spread their legs for anyone in order to get what they want.”
Even though this was the first time she had heard such an ugly term, the word being drilled into her ears didn’t shock her. There was no strength left in her body.
EunHa thought everything was fine. As long as she wasn’t locked up in here any longer. As long as she could eat and drink something, she would do everything he asked. She weakly nodded her head.
“Yes. I’m a whore.” “Haha, what did you say?”

SungHo coughed as he burst into laughter. He closed his eyes as he laughed, as if he was truly enjoying this. EunHa didn’t hesitate as she looked up at him and repeated the words once again. If saying this would take her out of this hellhole, she’d say it as many times as she could.
“I’m a rag. I’m a dirty whore.” “Puhahaha…”

Convulsing with laughter, SungHo wiped his tears as he grabbed her arm and pulled her up. At the realization that she could finally leave the storage room, she didn’t even feel the pain in her arm.
“If you try to escape one more time, I’ll really starve you to death.”
SungHo’s snake-like eyes gleamed right in front of her face.

“If you leave this place, you won’t be able to do anything.” “Yes, sir.”



As if to reaffirm her words, she frantically nodded her head.
SungHo shouted out in a piercing voice.
“Say it clearly with your own lips, you stupid girl!” “If… If I leave this place, there’s nothing I can do.”
She quickly repeated his words. Her eyes were filled with fear and dread.
“No one will take in a useless bitch.”

EunHa repeated SungHo’s words immediately. She repeated them a few more times for good measure.
“If you leave the organization, you’re a traitor. Traitors will be killed. There are no exceptions.”
Then SungHo left her in the apartment and told her not to take a step outside until he came back for her. All he left her was two boxes of cereal.
The starving mice no longer hid themselves in the apartment as they ravaged the moldy bread. They squeaked as they scurried across the old, wooden floorboards. Their long tails left streaks in the dust.
The door was locked. The only way she’d escape was by shattering the windows and jumping outside, so leaving the apartment was impossible. No one would save her in this city.
EunHa stretched out lifelessly on the dusty sofa like a marionette as she began to think.
She decided that the moment that door opened, she’d kill who she used to be and live on.
Like this, the crybaby, scaredy-cat sixteen-year-old girl was slowly being killed off.



TN: This was a difficult one to translate. Yikes! Such angst!







EunHa’s eyelashes were stuck together with dry tears. She pried her eyelids open as she blinked. She felt as if all the moisture had left her body. She slowly moved her limbs. KyungHyun, who was still holding EunHa’s body, asked softly in a hoarse voice.
“Are you okay?”

Instead of answering his question, EunHa stretched out her hand and touched the back of his head. She stroked his hair which was caked with dried blood. KyungHyun looked down at her.
“…I’m fine.”

Her wide eyes blinked. It didn’t seem like she could differentiate reality from her dreams. 30 minutes ago, EunHa had lost consciousness after her seizure. KyungHyun bit the inside of his cheek and asked her in a soft whisper.
“Do you know who I am?”

[What are those two blabbering about this time?!]

The man who had thrust the wooden stick with nails at KyungHyun raised the stick once more. EunHa flinched in surprise and stared at KyungHyun’s arm that was blocking the man from her sight.
“Don’t mind him. We’ll get out of here soon. As soon as you’ve regained you senses, we’ll…”
KyungHyun’s body stiffened. This was because EunHa, who was



still in his embrace, lifted her face and pressed a gentle kiss on his lips.
“Thank goodness. You’re not dead…”

Her tired voice whispered softly before her lips approached his once again. When her soft tongue roamed over his rough lips, his arms steadily tightened around her. KyungHyun lightly bit her lower lip and was just about to pull back when a wet tongue slid inside his mouth.
He only hesitated for an instant. KyungHyun immediately wrapped her tongue with his and lapped at it. To the men outside, KyungHyun and EunHa only looked like a lump of flesh, so they focused their attentions back onto their game.
KyungHyun and EunHa’s wet lips touched and pulled apart repeatedly. As if he was licking her wounds, KyungHyun softly pressed his lips against hers and caressed her face. There was definitely a source of groundwater somewhere near them. He didn’t want the cold from the cement floor to seep into her skin. KyungHyun held her tighter to keep her warm.
“…Do you know who I am?”

EunHa languidly blinked her eyes as she looked at him.

“I know.” “…Who am I?”
EunHa had been lost in painful nightmares just now. Hiding his anxiety, KyungHyun waited for her answer. She slowly replied.
“…The person I like.”

A hot breath burst out of his lips. They didn’t know who started it, but their wet lips crashed together again. KyungHyun shared his



mouth with her as he sucked and swallowed hers. His large hand wrapped around her face. The more intense their kiss became, the more EunHa felt her sanity return. She wrapped her arms around his neck and deepened their kiss.
“Haa…”

They licked and caressed every corner of each others’ mouths. She felt as if her thirst was becoming stronger. That may have been because he was sucking on her tongue and swallowing all of her saliva. However, she didn’t even think about pulling away from him. On the contrary, she felt her desire to be closer to him grow.
Not enough. This is not enough. EunHa panted as she held onto him.
EunHa rubbed his chest with her hand. KyungHyun, who had been pressing kisses onto her lips, cheeks and eyes, stiffened. With a trembling hand, she parted his dirty shirt. KyungHyun met her eyes as a hot breath left his lips.
“…EunHa.”

Instead of responding, EunHa parted her lips and pulled out her tongue. Seeing that she was craving another kiss, KyungHyun couldn’t hold back as he gave her what she wanted. A faint moan escaped from between their tangled lips. A slender finger got caught in his shirt and a button flew off. They could hear it tap against the floor as it rolled away. The hand that entered his parted shirt swept past his armpit and lightly grazed his back. That small movement aroused him to his limit.
“EunHa…”

He breathed out her name silently as he grasped her cheek with his hand. Her face was flushed and warm. As soon as he saw her dark, dilated pupils, KyungHyun realized that she hadn’t completely



overcome the effects of the drug just yet.

Even after having built a tolerance for stimulants in his 12 years of being in a criminal organization, KyungHyun still wasn’t be able to shake off the aphrodisiac properties of this drug. However, the intensity of its effects varied from person to person. While the intolerable hallucinations of her past were now over, the other effect of the drug began to consume EunHa’s body now.
“I’m…”

Li Kahui’s drug definitely had an aphrodisiac component added inside. EunHa’s wet eyes were silently pleading.
“I’m… thirsty…”

She licked her wet lips as she hung onto him. Her thirst was completely psychological. KyungHyun dug his teeth into the back of her neck. EunHa drew in a breath as her body trembled.
“More… more…”

She sounded like an injured bird chirping for food as she cried out into his ears. Her finger trembled as she roughly dragged it across his face. That wasn’t a caress. It was a desperate movement that stemmed from her need to feel his body heat. And KyungHyun knew how to make her feel a little better.
[What are those two doing stuck together like that?] [Is that lowlife seriously rubbing his cock against her?] [No way. In this situation?]
They could vaguely hear the Chinese men’s laughing comments, but KyungHyun didn’t pay it any mind and kissed EunHa’s ear. The sound of his wet kiss and the puffs of his hot breath caused the hairs on her skin to stand on edge. Her body gently turned around.



Wanting to hold onto him, she frantically tried to stick closer to him.
“Huu…” “It’s okay.”
Not covered by any underwear, the spot between her thighs was completely drenched. There was a sound of a zipper. Suddenly, KyungHyun pressed himself closer against her back. KyungHyun’s body was hot. EunHa felt as if her own body was burning. However, she didn’t want to push him away.
“H…Hurry…”

She turned her head and sought his lips. Just then, a stiff rod slid inside her in one breath.
“Hnng…!”

EunHa mewled like a cat that was searing for its mate. KyungHyun began to move slowly. He caressed her breasts and slowly pumped his hips. His cock plunged deeper into her warm depths. It repeatedly thrust in and out.
“Ah, ah…!”

EunHa couldn’t hold back her moans. She uncomfortably raised her arm and wrapped it around his neck. She wanted to be closer to him. This tickling sensation felt good, but it was also intolerable. Every time he pistoned in and out, the pleasure grew. However, it also made the thirst even worse.
“It’s okay.”

KyungHyun murmured in a hoarse voice and nibbled on the shell of her ear. It would have been better if she had felt pain instead. She pressed down on his hand that was holding her breast. KyungHyun breaths became heavier.



“Haa…”
He painfully squeezed her breast. However, this crushing sensation actually made her feel better. Tap, tap. The sound of his hips bumping into her bottom began to grow louder.
[Ah, those bastards are seriously fucking right now…!] Someone shouted, causing EunHa to flinch and tremble. “Don’t mind them.”
KyungHyun hugged her from behind as he murmured hotly into her ear. EunHa’s body was hidden by his. Those men would only see KyungHyun’s back. However, that didn’t change the fact that they were currently having sex in front of prying eyes.
“Ah, ah… ugh…!”

Feeling her sanity gradually return, EunHa raked her nails across the cement floor in front of her. She had been dragged here and injected with a drug against her will. She had relived her most painful memories in a series of nightmares and barely managed to wake up. Why was she doing this in their current situation? What did she want in such a dirty and disgusting situation?
Thoughts continued to run through her head. Even though she knew that they should stop, every time KyungHyun moved, her hips tried to hold onto him. Reason and instinct, humiliation and pleasure. She continued to bounce back and forth between them.
“It’s okay. You don’t have to hold back.”

KyungHyun murmured breathlessly as EunHa clenched her teeth to suppress her moans. He could feel her body gradually stiffen.
“Right now… In this moment, there’s only you and me.
Only the two of us.”



KyungHyun covered her eyes with his large hand. Half of her face was covered.
“I only see you right now. I can only feel you.”

Even though her vision darkened, EunHa felt the tension slip away.

“Nobody can come inside, EunHa.”

EunHa felt as if his voice was enveloping her whole body. The curses coming from the men outside began to fade away.
“Ahhng…! Nnng…!”

Loud moans burst out of her lips. KyungHyun plunged even deeper inside as his thrusts became more powerful. EunHa’s hand reached around and grasped his bottom. As if he could read her mind, KyungHyun began to pump faster and deeper. A husky groan hissed out from between his teeth.
[Haa… Fuck…]

The men were watching them with their mouths open. One of them cursed as he lowered his pants. They were aroused by the sex scene playing out in front of them in real time. Their eyes gleamed with desire as they gazed inside the barred room.
“Hug… I want to hug you…”

KyungHyun didn’t miss her soft plea. After pulling out of her, KyungHyun quickly laid her down on her back. He covered her slender body with his. Worried that she’d look to her side, KyungHyun quickly grasped her face. He wouldn’t let her see the lust coming from those trashy bastards outside. He didn’t want her to see anyone else but him.
“Kiss me… Please…”



Her parted lips were panting for breath. He crashed his lips onto hers and entered inside her wet walls once again as he caught his breath. He understood the thirst that was consuming her.
“Ah. Aaah!”

EunHa wrapped her legs around his waist and began to rock her hips against his. KyungHyun tightly held her to his chest and kissed her neck. He began to pound into her in reaction to her movements. Sweat began to trickle down their skins.
The men continued to watch them from the other side of the iron bars. One of them was lying on their backs, semen dripping from his penis.
“Nnng! Aaah!”

Because of the drug, EunHa couldn’t reach her climax easily. It was incredibly painful, and her body began to shake. Still wedged inside her, KyungHyun lifted her up and sat her on his lap. EunHa gripped his shoulders as her body trembled.
“I-It feels weird. My body feels so… weird…”

EunHa cried out as she whispered to KyungHyun. During sex, she usually felt more satisfied the further they proceeded. However, right now, she craved more.
“It’s not weird. It’s hot and soft. It feels good.”

KyungHyun met her movements as he lifted his hips. Their groins continued to slam together and the sound of his scrotum slapping against her bottom rang inside the room.
“It’s okay, so we can keep going. As much as you want.”

Deep inside her, KyungHyun grabbed her hips and began to move her up and down. Their wet pubic hairs tangled together. As she



panted for breath, EunHa’s eyes began to fill with tears. As her sweet spot continued to be stimulated, her expression held a mixture of dread and pleasure.
Would it really be okay? Was this truly okay? Could she shed her humanity and let loose like a beast? No, this might actually be the real me. I’ve already gone so crazy with pleasure that I don’t even care where I am. I don’t care who’s watching. All my instincts crave is sex.
“Now… stop…”

Because of the drug, as her pleasure began to pile up, EunHa felt a growing sense of humiliation and shame. EunHa’s face twisted as if she were in pain.
“I love you.”

KyungHyun’s piercing gaze caught EunHa’s eyes. He confessed to her in an unbelievable situation without any warning yet again. A sorrowful cry left EunHa’s lips as she panted for breath. KyungHyun licked her tears and whispered in a fierce voice.
“I think I’ve fallen for you all over again.”

KyungHyun recalled the way she had turned the truck around in order to save him, the way she had desperately tried to turn Li Kahui’s attention away from him. Behind this bold EunHa hid a terrible past.
“You’re strong. You’re beautiful.”

As KyungHyun clearly murmured these words to her, EunHa felt as if her surroundings had faded away. Their breaths became one.
“Don’t worry. You don’t have to worry about anything anymore.”



“Haa…”
KyungHyun’s voice in her ear seemed to suck her soul out of her body. She couldn’t escape it. She felt her body become absorbed into his soft, soothing world. All she could feel was him.
“Because I want you more than you want me.”

She felt like she was going to become addicted to this dreamy sensation. This man wanted her just as much, no, even more than she wanted him. Nothing else mattered. She tightly wrapped her arms around him and began to gasp for breath.
[Those two are seriously crazy…]

Outside the iron bars, one of the men got up and began to approach them. KyungHyun gently wrapped his hand over the back of her head and glared at them. The men, whose pants were down, exposing their lower halves, saw KyungHyun’s violent glare. They hesitated and couldn’t bring themselves to enter the cell.
‘I’ll kill you all.’

KyungHyun’s eyes were warning them. His possessive hand gently stroked EunHa’s back. Within his embrace, EunHa struggled as the blinding climax finally hit her.



“EunHa.”

EunHa awoke from the darkness. She felt someone carefully touching her cheek. EunHa slowly opened her eyes as KyungHyun continued to sweep his hand across her face.
“Do you think you’ll be able to move?” “…Yes.”
After she had fainted, the men outside the bars turned away and began to drowse from boredom. However, they suddenly began to speak noisily.
“If you’re okay, I’m planning on getting us out of here. The transaction will begin soon. When it does, everyone here will scatter, and we’ll escape then.”
Li Kahui had given Im SungJoon two hours to prepare the money. It was now almost 4 AM. There was less than 30 minutes left. There was no guarantee that they would escape with their lives intact even after the completion of the transaction. EunHa nodded almost imperceptibly.
[The Korean guy says he brought the money.] [Go upstairs and make sure.]
One of the men pulled back from the mahjong table and checked his phone. Then he hurriedly went upstairs and disappeared. Unable to understand their conversation, KyungHyun could only stare outside the iron bars. Suddenly, EunHa softly whispered something to



him.

“It looks like the money from YongSung has arrived.”

The remaining Chinese man glanced at them before smacking his lips as he tried to win over his sleepiness. He pulled out a cigarette and inserted it between his lips. The best chance to escape was now when there was only one guard left.
“Then I’ll go now. It should be okay, right?” “Yeah.”
Their eyes met for a moment.

“Don’t look outside.”

KyungHyun murmured quietly. Without taking his eyes off hers, he began to move his arm. He stretched his hand through the iron bars and quickly snatched the wooden stick that was lying on the floor.
[Ugh, uhh!]

The smoking man got up from his seat in surprise. He approached the iron bars when KyungHyun swung the wooden beam with protruding nails precisely at his stomach. As the man let out a cry and clutched his stomach, KyungHyun struck a blow at his head. This all happened in a blink of an eye.
[You bastard…!]

Staggering under the sudden shock, the man went back to the table and grabbed a sharp kitchen knife.
[I’ll kill you.]

The man began to grind his teeth from the sharp pain. His face was red with rage. As if provoking him, KyungHyun threw the wooden stick onto the floor and rammed his fist against the iron bars.



“Come here.”

As soon as he saw that KyungHyun no longer held a weapon, the man began to charge at him.
[Ugh!]

The man thrust his knife haphazardly through the iron bars. KyungHyun grabbed his wrist and wrenched his arm to the side in one breath. It seemed that KyungHyun had been waiting for the man to come closer all along.
[Aaagh!]

There was a snap. It sounded like his bone had been completely dislocated from the joint. The man dropped the knife due to the pain. KyungHyun immediately snatched the knife from the floor. He didn’t hesitate as he thrust the knife into the belly of the man who was still leaning on the iron bars.
Shouting out a few more curses, the man slowly collapsed to the floor. KyungHyun pulled the man closer and began to rummage through the man’s pockets.
Damn it.

KyungHyun’s cold face twisted. He checked both pockets, but there was no key. The man who had disappeared upstairs probably had it. Did they have to wait for him to return? As KyungHyun pondered this, he heard a dull, metallic clink.
“Let’s go.”

Meanwhile, EunHa had picked up a rusty nail from the floor and picked the lock. She finally managed to open the cell door. EunHa had successfully unlocked her own handcuffs and gotten into KyungHyun’s safe back at the hotel. And now, he finally witnessed her lock-picking skills with his own eyes. A faint smile stretched



across his lips.
“…All right.”

He grabbed EunHa’s hand and walked out of the cell. They were currently in the level 2 basement of the building. The entrance to the building was on the ground floor, and the room where they had met Li Kahui was located on the floor above them, basement level 1.
In order to escape this building, they needed to at least get past the level 1 basement. That meant that they wouldn’t be able to avoid Im SungJoon and his men along with the rest of the Chinese gangsters.
“Watch your step.” “Okay.”
EunHa answered curtly as she followed behind him. Unlike the few steps they took to come down to basement level 1, there were many steep steps to basement level 2. That was how far the organization had dug into the ground.
The cells in the basement looked like prison cells. Its dirty floors were dyed with blood splatters. EunHa didn’t want to know the story behind them. She remembered how Li Kahui had mentioned human fertilizers, and a shiver went down her spine. She had no intention of staying here any longer. With a lump in her throat, EunHa carefully walked up the stairs.
Clink.

They had just reached the top of the stairs when they heard someone on the other side of the iron door. The handle began to turn. It looked like the man who went upstairs had returned. Flustered, EunHa froze in place. As EunHa looked up at him with wide eyes, KyungHyun pushed her flat against the wall and pulled the turning door handle.



[Wh-What the…!] “Stand back.”
At KyungHyun’s soft command, EunHa pressed her back onto the wall. Having lost his balance, the man who had been on the other side of the door stumbled forward. KyungHyun took this chance to thrust his fist into the man’s abdomen.
[Uugh!]

With a dark, twisted face, the man reached into his pants and took out his gun. KyungHyun quickly snapped his wrist.
Bang!

The man pulled the trigger but ended up shooting his own shoulder. He groaned out in pain. In the midst of the man’s cries, KyungHyun quickly raised his leg and kicked him. The man’s body plunged down the stairs.
Holding his cellphone, Im SungJoon suddenly frowned when he heard the gunshot.
“…What was that?”

He was annoyed that there was no signal in this damn basement.

“Hey, that was a gunshot just now, right?” “Yes, Hyung-nim.”
Im SungJoon’s face darkened. His expression turned grave, and wrinkles traveled across his slightly crooked nose.
“Isn’t that bastard Shin KyungHyun being kept downstairs?” 
Im SungJoon and his translator began to observe the Chinese men



in the room, who had begun to speak noisily amongst themselves.
“These men have ears, so I’m sure they heard it too…”

“I think I need to go down myself and check out what’s going on.”
Im SungJoon began to turn his body towards the door when one of Li Kahui’s men blocked him.
[You cannot move until the transaction has been completed.]
“Move.”

Having his path blocked, Im SungJoon no longer hid his annoyance and waved his hand.
[I clearly told you that you cannot leave this room until the transaction has been completed.]
The room was was filled with tension once again. The translator quietly whispered to Im SungJoon.
“Hyung-nim, they said that until the transaction is completed…”
“Fuck, then they should go, those sons of a bitches.”

The translator’s forehead was drenched with sweat. He filtered out the curses and spoke to the man. However, the men who had been ordered to watch Im SungJoon merely had a gruff expression on their faces and didn’t move from their spots.
“They said they can’t leave until their boss orders them to…”
“It’ll be here in 10 minutes! We’re doin’ some important business here. They need to make sure everythin’ is runnin’



smoothly. Do they want everythin’ to go to shit?”

Before the translator could finish his sentence, Im SungJoon roared out in a loud voice.
“Ten men! Fuck, how do you say ‘ten men’ in Chinese?!”

Before the translator could reply, Im SungJoon stretched out his fingers on both hands and held them up.
“Shin KyungHyun, that phantom bastard. You need to send at least ten men to catch him!”
It wasn’t that Im SungJoon hadn’t tried to kill him in the past. Every time Im SungJoon had tried to get him, Shin KyungHyun had exceeded his expectations and escaped alive. Shin KyungHyun had a knack for surviving and never hesitated to kill. At this rate, this business deal would fail, and everyone would go to hell with it.
“Do I look like I’m jokin’ right now?”

Im SungJoon hissed through his clenched teeth, his face twisted into a scowl. Seeing Im SungJoon’s expression, one of the men gestured to one of his lackeys with his eyes. They also felt that something strange was going on downstairs.
Suddenly, they received word that Li Kahui would soon arrive.

Not wanting their boss to witness such a chaotic scene, the captain of the remaining Chinese gangsters ordered the men to go downstairs.
[Tell the men who are waiting for the Boss’s arrival to come down here as soon as he arrives.]
One by one, the men picked up their weapons that were strewn on top of a table and disappeared downstairs.



“Hyung-nim, it seems that Li Kahui will be arriving shortly.”

Im SungJoon bit out a curse and swept up his hair that was drenched with sweat. He hadn’t experienced such a long night in a while.
At first, it was one man. After the gunshot, more men began to appear one by one. KyungHyun nervously bit the inside of his cheek. No matter how many men he threw down, more men popped up in their place. Because of that, they hadn’t been able to take one more step from the door leading to the level 1 basement.
Vrrr. Vrrr.

The lightbulb hanging above them rocked back and forth, illuminating all the men who had fallen by KyungHyun’s hand.
“Watch out!”

A man holding a knife began to approach EunHa, who had been helping KyungHyun by pressing down on the pressure point of a man. EunHa barely managed to avoid it, but the man began to charge at her once more. KyungHyun grabbed him by the throat and lifted him.
[Ugh, uh… Agh!]

The man holding the knife fell off the railing, screaming as he dropped. KyungHyun let out a ragged breath.
“Are you okay?” “I’m fine.”
EunHa replied curtly, hiding her anxiety as she nodded. She noticed once again that there were more steps from basement level 1 to basement level 2 than the steps connecting the ground floor to basement level 1. The reason why the men who had fallen off the railings couldn’t move was that they had broken bones from the



impact of hitting the floor.

“Then let’s go. They’re increasing the more we linger here.”
“…Wait, something’s strange.”

EunHa looked up at KyungHyun and murmured as he grabbed her hand and began moving forward. Because she had been imprisoned by SungHo often as a young girl, she was particularly sensitive to sound and smell. When she heard the cries of the men who had fallen, EunHa felt that the echoes sounded strange. Unaware of this, KyungHyun softly asked her.
“What is it?” “Over there.”
EunHa pointed over to an area near a man with a snapped neck. “I think there’s something on the other side of that wall.” “What?”
The hanging lightbulb on the ceiling flashed as it rocked back and forth. Its light didn’t reach that part of the basement because it was located behind the staircase, so it remained dark. EunHa continued speaking with a thoughtful expression on her face.
“The echoes of the cries spread out and linger over there.” “…Are you saying that there might be a passageway
leading somewhere else?”

A faint gleam flashed across KyungHyun’s eyes as he murmured. If this building had been built for the purpose of manufacturing drugs as Li Kahui said, then it wouldn’t be unusual for a few secret passageways to be built inside. It was also strange how the door



opening into the level 1 basement had a lock on the inside. If this floor was reserved for imprisoning people, the lock would normally be on the outside.
“I’m going to go down and check it out.”

Before KyungHyun could make a decision, EunHa began to put her words into action. KyungHyun locked the door and hurriedly went down the stairs. As always, he followed after her.
[Uugh…!]

As he followed EunHa, KyungHyun saw one of the men on the floor begin to crawl after her. KyungHyun immediately kicked him back down. EunHa also began to stomp down on the men strewn out across the floor with all her might as she walked over to the corner.
“……”

EunHa quickly walked behind the staircase and stopped in her tracks. Her hunch had been correct. In this dark space, a sliver of light was seeping out. It was a tunnel that was just wide enough for one person to safely make it through at a time. EunHa’s heart raced at the intense relief that came over her body.
“…I think we can leave through here.” EunHa looked at KyungHyun in relief. Suddenly… Boom!
They heard the clank of the door handle and a boom as someone kicked against the door. KyungHyun and EunHa whipped their heads around to see what was happening upstairs.
[Is it locked?] [Open up!]



The shouts were coming from outside the door. EunHa’s face paled once again.
[Don’t you know there isn’t a key to this door?] [Then just break it down!]
“What did they say just now?”

KyungHyun looked questioningly at EunHa. EunHa chewed on her lips.
“They said there isn’t a key. They’re going to break down the door instead.”
After hearing EunHa’s words, KyungHyun reached down and took out a gun from one of the men’s waistbands. With an experienced hand, he checked the magazine. Then he grasped her shoulder.
“Go.”

“Yeah, let’s hurry.”

“When you meet Kang SungHo, shoot him with this.”

EunHa looked up at him in confusion when she heard his unexpected command. Just as KyungHyun was about to place the gun in her hand, EunHa pulled it away with a frown.
“What are you doing?”

“This basement tunnel probably connects to the outside. Since this is in a place where you can lock the door from the inside, it will probably lead you to a safe place. So move quickly. Call Kang SunHo when you’re out.”
“Then what about you?”

EunHa asked in return. KyungHyun raised his hand and rubbed his



thumb over her cheek to wipe off a smudge of dust.

“I’ll follow you soon.”

It didn’t make any sense. EunHa’s frown deepened instantly. Suddenly, they heard someone beating against the door with an axe. It would only be a matter of time before the door flew open. EunHa frantically shook her head.
“No way.”

Her eyes were filled with fear. She wasn’t an idiot. She knew what KyungHyun meant. He was telling her that he would stay behind alone. He would let her escape on her own and stay behind to fend off the swarm of Li Kahui’s men in order to buy her some time.
“Don’t be ridiculous. No way.”

Instead of telling him she didn’t want to, she told him there was no way. No matter how stubborn this man was, she wasn’t going to give him a chance to do what he wanted this time. EunHa gripped KyungHyun’s wrist tightly, but he didn’t move a muscle.
“Lee EunHa.” “Hurry, let’s go.”
It wasn’t that she didn’t understand his reasoning. If both of them tried to escape, there was a higher chance that both of them would die. However, if only one of them ran away, the chance of that one person making it out alive was greater. But she still couldn’t leave him behind.
“Let’s quickly leave while we still have the chance.” “Think about the reason why you came all the way here.”
KyungHyun’s steady words stopped the shrill voice leaving her lips.



EunHa’s black eyes shook dangerously.

“Didn’t you say so before? You said you would be the one to have your revenge on Kang SungHo. And you’re right. We don’t have much time, so get out of here this instant and have your revenge against that bastard with your own hands.”
EunHa had definitely told KyungHyun before that she wanted to get to know him more. That she wanted a fresh start with him. In order to do that, she told him she needed to cut the ill-fated ties she had with Kang SungHo. She couldn’t forget the words she said to him.
“But you…”

[It’s going to take years to get this door open at this rate!
Try shooting it!]

Bang! Bang!

The bullets created bumps in the iron door. Every time she heard a gunshot, EunHa’sbody flinched. KyungHyun caressed her shoulders and softly whispered.
“I won’t die.”

EunHa’s twisted eyes looked up at him with disbelief. She bit her lip so hard that it almost bled. She let out a tearful moan.
“And I’m sure the same goes for you. We still have a lot of things to do together, right?”
They heard more and more people rush towards the door.
KyungHyun gave her a small smile.

“Don’t turn me into a bastard who ruins a woman’s life.”



Her large eyes began to well up with hot tears. Her nose tingled and her eyes reddened.
“Tears are only meant to be shed at funerals.” “There’s too many people.”
She blurted out the words in order to try and convince him one last time.
“Back-up will be here soon.”

How could they know about this place? And even if they did arrive, would they get here before the door was forced open? KyungHyun watched as she struggled with these thoughts, unable to put them into words. As if he read her mind, he spoke up.
“You know, I’m actually a lot more competent than you think.”
EunHa realized that KyungHyun had already made up his mind. And she knew that nothing she said would change it. This was the result of liking a man with a strong ego who was just as stubborn as her.
“I’ve never thought of you as incompetent.” “Thank goodness for that.”
KyungHyun smiled as he tightly gripped her shoulders.

“Just promise me one thing.” “What is it?”
Tears dripped down from EunHa’s eyes as she struggled to keep them on him.
“Don’t look back.”



“……”
Her long eyelashes shook. KyungHyun looked at her carefully.

“No matter what happens, you mustn’t look back. Don’t be an idiot and come back for me like you did yesterday. Understand?”
He was telling her not to look back no matter how loud or rough it sounded behind her. She wanted to ask him how that could be possible, but the words never came out. The result of EunHa turning the truck around to save KyungHyun had led to this exact situation.
“I’m sorry.”

“No need to apologize. And there won’t be anything for you to apologize for.”
This was the first time his confident voice sounded so scary to her. EunHa wanted to believe him. She told herself she needed to believe him. However, she couldn’t do it, causing her to feel distressed instead.
“All you need to do is kill Kang SungHo with this. Have the revenge you wanted, and I’ll stay here to catch all these criminals. Okay?”
EunHa bit her lip and took the gun he held out to her. Her slender hands were wet with sweat as they trembled. Her large eyes were filled with tears as they shook.
“Let’s go on a date at the movie theater once this is all over.”
Boom!

They heard gunshots behind them as the door broke. The iron door fell down the stairs with a crash. EunHa’s whole body hardened with



fear.

[Where are those bastards?!] [Let’s go down and find them!]
KyungHyun quickly shoved her into the tunnel and lowered his head as he quietly asked.
“What kind of movie do you like?”

Their eyes met. When she saw his smile, her heart went cold. It felt as if there was a hole in her heart and a chilly wind was blowing through it. However, she wouldn’t cry in front of him. He told her that tears were only meant to be shed at funerals. Her reddened eyes narrowed as she did her best to smile.
“As long as it doesn’t have a sad ending, I like all of them.” “I’ll keep that in mind.”
KyungHyun lightly tapped the tip of her nose and softly whispered. Before her tears began dripping down her cheek, EunHa held back her cry and quickly turned around. Clenching her fists, she began to walk further into the cramped tunnel.
[Ah, there he is!]

[Catch him before he escapes!]

Someone shouted out when they discovered KyungHyun. Once voice turned into several in an instant. Seven, no, eight? More than that?
[Just kill him!] [Uugh!!]
EunHa clenched her teeth and ran. She moved her stiff legs like



crazy. The more she felt ashamed for leaving on her own, the faster she ran. A sorrowful sob escaped her clenched lips.
Bang!

A gunshot echoed through the tunnel from far away. KyungHyun didn’t have a gun.
Bang! Bang!

“Aaaah!!!”

She remembered KyungHyun telling her not to look back. A cry tore out of her throat as she ran and ran. Splash, splash. As she made her way further into the tunnel, the floor became wet with groundwater. In this dark tunnel, only the sounds of her feet and her loud cries rang in the air.
All of her loved ones had died in front of her eyes. And even though she knew that, she ended up running away every time.
Tears streamed down her dirty cheeks. History kept repeating itself.
Once she killed Kang SungHo today, she would also die. There was nothing left to lose. Nothing left to fear.
EunHa bit her lips until they bled. Her whole body was drenched with sweat. She finally saw the end of this never-ending tunnel.
“Haa, haa…”

EunHa grasped the rusty ladder and panted for breath. She held back her nausea and trembled as she put one foot above the other, making her way up the ladder. Clenching her teeth, she barely managed to lift the manhole cover at the top and push it to the side. She felt the sea breeze brush against her face.



A harbor appeared right before her eyes.





“It’s me.”
⦁	Hey, where are you right now…
Through the receiver of the pay phone, EunHa heard someone grab the cellphone before YongJoon could finish his sentence.
⦁	Lee EunHa. What’s going on?
SungHo called her name, his voice filled with anger. EunHa looked off into the distance and replied in a thin voice.
“I got the goods. Where should I meet you?”

Instead of answering his question, she got straight to the point.
SungHo answered her in a curt voice.
⦁	The boat’s ready. Come to Shekou Harbor F-34 in the Nanshan district.
“Okay. I’ll be there soon.”

After hearing their location, EunHa ended the call before SungHo could say anything more. She stretched out her long legs and walked to a main street. She raised a hand, causing the dress to ride up her thigh. A truck stopped in front of her. The driver was a man with a bushy beard. He flashed his yellow teeth as he called out to her.
[Why, hello there, little beauty. If you’re trying to get customers here, you’ll be arrested very quickly…]
The chatty driver’s face darkened. He watched the gun bob as she pointed it at him. Not knowing what to do, the driver opened the car



door.

Vroom.

EunHa stepped on the accelerator pedal. Her face remained blank.
The car began to speed up.

Shekou Harbor, Nanshan District, Shenzhen. 4 AM.

The sky remained dark as if the night would never end. Fretting anxiously as he waited, Kang SungHo rushed over to EunHa as soon as he saw her.
“What about the goods?” “Go and see for yourself.”
EunHa’s narrow eyes looked down at her blackened nails as she slowly murmured. She was acting arrogant, but there was no time to discuss her behavior. Kang SungHo looked over at YongJoon with a grave expression on his face. He gestured to him with his eyes. YongJoon hurriedly walked over to the truck. He opened the trailer and checked inside. His face hardened.
“Why aren’t you bringing it in?”

YongJoon hesitated and didn’t move. SungHo frowned.

“Boss, this is definitely it! There’s a lot of it, too. I’ll move it in before dawn.”
YongJoon raised his voice. SungHo lit a cigarette after hearing the confirmation. YongJoon quickly got into the driver’s seat and began to move the trailer truck towards the boat. EunHa smiled bitterly as she watched YongJoon try to hide his confusion. Judging from the purple bruise on his cheek, it looked like SungHo had beat him quite a lot last night.



YongJoon tried to catch EunHa’s eyes through the truck window but quickly looked away so that SungHo wouldn’t notice. EunHa thought that YongJoon would have run straight back to SungHo after checking the contents of the truck. However, that cowardly punk must have felt that it would be best for him to leave the scene as soon as possible instead. Either way, EunHa didn’t think it mattered. The best moments in life were meant to be savored.
“Come and take a cigarette.”

EunHa silently received a lit cigarette from SungHo.

“Have another one before you leave, Ahjussi. Why are you in such a hurry?”
SungHo, who had been walking back onto the anchored boat in the dark, stopped in his tracks and took out another cigarette. The gray smoke disappeared in the salty wind of the sea.
“You look terrible.”

SungHo looked EunHa up and down. Her dirty Chinese dress was torn here and there. Her hair was tangled and disheveled. EunHa took a long drag of the cigarette and slowly exhaled as she nodded.
“Some troublesome things happened in the process, so I’ve been through a lot.”
SungHo arrived at Hong Kong last night. However, when he didn’t hear a word from EunHa, he was up all night worrying. He wondered if she had backstabbed him and run off with the drugs instead. He had sent YongJoon to keep watch over her, but that idiot said that he didn’t know where EunHa had gone. As soon as he heard this, SungHo held back the urge to dump him into the sea. SungHo took a deep drag of his cigarette as he pretended to stay calm.
“Well, I’ll hear the details later. It must’ve been difficult bringing the goods here.”



To SungHo, results were the most important thing. He imagined the tens of millions he’d earn from selling the priceless drugs. However, he never expected her to bring the whole trailer container with her. It would make passing through customs a lot easier. He realized that all of the discipline and education he had given her weren’t for nothing.
“Good work.”

EunHa watched as he parted his dry lips. For a moment, she kept the silence. Then she burst out laughing. The scar on SungHo’s brow twitched.
“……”
“Haha… Hahaha…”

EunHa’s shoulders shook as she roared with laughter. Seeing this, SungHo frowned unpleasantly. He looked at her disheveled hair and her messy, torn dress as she continued to laugh. She truly looked like a crazy person.
“What is it?”

“Ahjussi, about that trailer truck that YongPal just drove to the boat…”
EunHa grinned at him with sparkling eyes.

“What do you think is inside?”

EunHa began to raise her fingers as if she were quizzing him.
“Number 1: drugs. Number 2: ﬂour. Number 3: knock-off dolls. Or Number 4: nothing.”
EunHa happily watched as SungHo’s face twisted. It looked like he wasn’t able to tell whether she was joking around or being honest.



“…What kind of game are you playing right now?”
It didn’t look like he had his usual 15 centimeter knife on him. When she heard his unpleasant voice, EunHa gathered her palms together and drew them to her chest as if she were praying. Her long eyelashes fluttered.
“Let me give you a hint. It’s something you really like, Ahjussi.”
“Lee EunHa.”

SungHo threw his half-used cigarette onto the ground as he ground his teeth. It looked like he was about to grab her hair. EunHa pretended to be surprised as she lowered her voice.
“It looks like you’ll really get mad if I continue joking around.”
“If you know that already, then keep your mouth shut.”

SungHo’s eyes gleamed dangerously. EunHa flashed her teeth at him as she smiled.
“The correct answer is number 3. It’s stuffed animals of knock-off cartoon characters. There’s about two thousand of them.”
“…What did you say?”

“I think it suits you perfectly, Ahjussi. You like knock-offs, right?”
“Lee EunHa.”

SungHo’s face twisted. EunHa was still smiling, but her eyes flashed gleefully. She looked like a crazy woman, and the sight caused shivers to run down his spine.



“Are you insane?”

“No. Not yet. If I’d really gone insane, I wouldn’t have gone through hell to extract the drugs for a bastard like you, you son of a bitch.”
When he saw the vicious transformation take place in her eyes, SungHo realized that something had gone terribly wrong.
“Why you fucking bitch…!”

Right as he was about to grab her throat, EunHa quickly took a step back. Then she took out the gun that she had strapped to her garter belt. When he saw the pistol, SungHo’s eyes shook. His hand that had been raised to strike her began to tremble in the air. He let out a ragged breath.
“…You bitch… Put that down right now!” “Why did you do it?”
The smile disappeared from EunHa’s face. Only a chilly aura remained. Her pale face gleamed in the light.
“‘Why did you do it’? That’s what I should be asking you, you bitch!”
His grating voice burst out of his mouth. He couldn’t contain his rage. He took a step forward to snap her wrist. He felt that his rage wouldn’t settle down even if he strangled her to death.
Bang!

Suddenly, EunHa shot her gun.

“Ugh!”

Having lost his balance due to the shock and pain, SungHo grasped his bleeding thigh and let out a short groan. Warm blood began to



spurt out of the wound.

“Your head is next, Ahjussi.”

EunHa shook the muzzle of the gun as she smiled. Seeing this, SungHo began to tremble. The EunHa he knew wouldn’t have been able to shoot him. He began to grind his teeth. EunHa continued to speak calmly.
“You still haven’t answered my question. Why did you do it?”
“Ugh…”

SungHo’s eyes blazed due to the dizzying pain as he glared at her.

“What kind of bullshit is this?” “Are you pretending not to know?”
When he continued to let out a hoarse groan, EunHa shrugged her shoulders.
“That’s too bad.”

When SungHo saw the muzzle of the gun aim at his head, he gasped as he took in a ragged breath.
“You parents… Is that what you’re talking about right now?”
The edge of EunHa’s mouth slightly trembled. It had finally happened. Kang SungHo spoke about the events of that night with his own mouth.
“Do you think I’m asking you why you killed my parents right now?”
“…That’s not it? Aren’t you making all this fuss because of



the accident that happened 10 years ago?” “Accident?”
EunHa put on a contrived expression as she frowned. She tilted her head.
Bang!

Another shot rang out.
“Uugh…!”

SungHo fell to his knees. Both of his thighs had been shot. His knees banged onto the floor, but it was no match for the pain from the gunshot wounds.
“Oh dear. I never expected you to kneel before me.” Watching him gasp for breath, EunHa spoke emotionlessly. “Seo YongJoon!!!”
SungHo looked back with a twisted frown as he called for YongJoon. However, the truck continued to face the boat and didn’t move from the harbor. Because merchandise moved in and out of this harbor 24 hours a day, it was usually filled with trailer containers and workers. However, for some reason, it was oddly silent today. Not even an ant could be seen.
“In Yangpyeong, during the wintertime, why did you take me with you? You should have killed me instead.”
EunHa asked in a weak, trembling voice. Her eyes glistened with tears as she slowly blinked her eyes.
“You should have killed me just like you killed my parents.
Why did you toy with me instead?”



With bloody hands, SungHo swept his hair off his forehead. His breaths were ragged.
“You… Do you think I toyed with you?”

“You’re saying you didn’t? You made the daughter of the man you killed submit to you. As you watched her dream of a misguided revenge, how much did you enjoy it?”
Listening to her cold words, SungHo glared at her and raised his voice.
“No! Like you said, I could have killed you. But I saved you instead. I gave you a new life!”
SungHo’s eyes flashed with lunacy. EunHa gave a dejected laugh as she frowned. Her eyes glistened with tears as she laughed hysterically.
“Aah. I find you so funny, Ahjussi.”

“I’m the one who took you in even though you were a useless girl. I clothed you, fed you, and educated you. I did everything you wanted. But you dare to fuck me over after the 10 years I’ve endured because of you?!”
SungHo’s scarred brow twisted. It didn’t matter where things had begun to go wrong. He had taken in this abandoned dog and spent money on it as he raised it. But this dog dared to get off its leash and charge at its master? SungHo couldn’t take it anymore.
“All because I killed your father? Just because I killed your barmaid of a mother… You dare to betray me after the 10 years I’ve spent on you?!”
“I’d rather you beg me.”

EunHa murmured, looking down at him as if she were gazing at a



bug. Kang SungHo didn’t stop. It was as if he had finally revealed his true nature.
“Do you know what kind of face your father made as I killed him? He looked as if he had expected everything. As if he knew this day would come. He was the one who chose not to leave the mob life! Even though he was a mere thug, he went off, got married, and even had a kid as if he was living some kind of love song. And this was the result of his choices!”
SungHo’s dark red blood pooled on the floor. The image of her father’s blood pooling on the floor. The image of her mother’s blood on the staircase. It all overlapped, one on top of the other. EunHa’s downcast eyes filled with tears when SungHo began to cackle as he ridiculed her.
“Your father should be thanking me for not killing his only daughter. For saving her. Don’t you think?”
SungHo’s eyes twisted. EunHa was surprised to see such confidence in his eyes. A human’s true nature was chillingly selfish and hideous. It was no different from a beast.
“I’m the one who raised you and protected you until now! I’m the one who made you strong so that you could survive no matter where I dropped you off. I’m the one who made it all possible, you stupid bitch!”
“…I said you should beg me instead.”

EunHa’s faint voice left her lips once again. If he had begged her for forgiveness, she would have sent him off with one blow. However, Kang SungHo was currently chipping away at the last remnants of her humanity.
“I’m the one who knows you the best in this world.”

He held out his blood-drenched hands to her.



“Once you hold this hand, you will become a part of my family.”
10 years ago, a sixteen-year-old girl had been unable to see the bloodstains on the hand that was held out to her. EunHa chewed on her lip as she looked down at him.
“Don’t make me laugh.”

“Lee EunHa, you’re not a dirty bitch who has the ability to kill people. I know that!”
“I wonder if that’s true.”

Kang SungHo snickered at her.

“I still remember it like it was yesterday. You on your knees as you rubbed your hands, begging me to save your life. You told me you’d do anything as long as I saved your life. You even offered to take your clothes off and thrusted yourself at me even though you smelled like urine. I still remember it all!”
“…Shut up.”

Remembering the memories she wanted to forget, EunHa’s brows furrowed. Her gun trembled as she tried to keep it aimed on SungHo. SungHo noticed the disturbance in her eyes.
“But what did I do? Did I rape you? No! Me?! To a rag bitch like you?! No, I treated you as if you were the purest person in the world. Even if all the bastards in the world treated you like a whore, I treated you like my daughter. I protected you like a princess and loved you! This is what love is, you stupid bitch! Even though I killed your father! Even though I killed your mother, I didn’t kill you! Even though I could have killed you, I saved you! Because I felt sorry for you as I watched you crawled on the ﬂoor! Even though you were like that, I



loved you!”

“Stop the bullshit!!”

A hoarse scream tore out of her lips. Rage began to boil up from her chest. She felt as if her head was going to explode. Unable to endure the hatred, she began to walk towards him. She wanted to rip his mouth off , just as he had threatened her before. If she had been holding a knife, she would have done exactly that. Unfortunately, because she didn’t have one, it was impossible. But she still felt that she could settle for filling his body with bullet holes.
“Love…? Love?!!”

EunHa’s eyes bulged and the blue veins in her pale neck began to throb. She felt as if her throat would burst open. Kang SungHo had no right to use that word. Listening to her voice hoarse with rage, Kang SungHo yelled back, his spit spraying from his mouth.
“Yeah! I’m the only one in this world who can love you with a pure heart. But you already know that very well, don’t you?”
EunHa had reached the limits of her patience. She quickly walked over to him. Then she crouched down, held up the gun, and fiercely whipped it against his head.
“I told you to shut up!”
“You stupid bitch…! That’s why you’re useless!”

He captured her slender wrist and snapped it back in one breath.
EunHa bit her lips from the sharp pain.
“Mm…!”

The gun fell from her hand and slid across the ground. SungHo continued to murmur.



“Wake up from this madness and beg me for your life right this instant… Just like you always did, twitching like a dirty bug on the ﬂoor as you crawl for me… Because of our past together, I’ll let this go with only a slash across your face… Hmm?”
Suddenly, EunHa raised her leg and kicked him in the gut.

“Shut up! Shut up!!”

Even if everyone in the world laughed at her life choices, it didn’t matter to her. But not Kang SungHo.
“Uugh!”

He let out a pained groan, but he still managed to grab the hem of her dress. EunHa, who had fallen onto her back from the kick, found herself underneath Kang SungHo. He began to strangle her neck with both his hands.
“Hmm…!”
“You can’t do anything. If I’m not here, you’re nothing… How dare you betray me?”
Her eyes bulged from the pain as her airways were blocked. Her cheek pressed against the ground. She tried to push him off, but all strength left her fingertips. Her blurry vision landed on the gun that had slid under the trailer truck.
“Uugh… Ugh…!”

That was the gun KyungHyun had given her as he sent her off by herself. For her revenge. She recalled the last time she saw KyungHyun’s face as he told her to kill Kang SungHo. To end their ill- fated ties.
She couldn’t end it like this.



“Aaaagh…!”
EunHa’s fingers began to dig into the gunshot wounds in Kang SungHo’s thighs. Having experienced a gunshot wound herself, she knew how painful it was. As Kang SungHo cried out, his hands left her neck and began to strike her across her cheeks. Blood burst from her lips, but EunHa didn’t feel the pain.
“Cough… cough…“
EunHa began to violently cough as she drew in deep breaths. She barely managed to move her limp body. Then she grabbed his hand and began to bite it.
“You fucking dog bitch!!”

Kang SungHo roared out in pain and began to beat her head. EunHa continued to glare at him. If he called her a dog, then it was only apt that she bite the hand that had fed her trash for 10 years.
“Haaa… teh…!”

EunHa spat out the blood in her mouth. She swayed as she got up and began to crawl over to the trailer truck to get the gun.
“Haa… Haa…”

She wondered if her eardrums had burst. Everything sounded muﬄed and her head felt dizzy. She tried to gather her balance and focus her eyes so that she didn’t fall. Because of the gunshot wounds on each of his legs, Kang SungHo couldn’t run after her.
“B…Boss!”

Having moved the merchandise into the boat, YongJoon came back and saw the scene before his eyes. Shocked, he froze in his tracks.
“Kill that bitch immediately!!”



He pointed over to EunHa with bloodied hands as he roared. YongJoon looked back and forth between the bloodied SungHo and EunHa who was crawling on the floor. He couldn’t hide his shock. His feet began to move back and forth in his new shoes.
“Kill her!!! Why aren’t you killing her, you stupid bastard?!!! Kill her right now, kill her!!!”
EunHa stretched out her hand underneath the trailer truck as she tried to reach the gun. She turned her head and looked up at YongJoon.
“You son of a bitch, kill her right now!”

YongJoon clenched his fist as he approached her. She might have been able to overpower the wounded SungHo, but there was no chance she’d win a fight with YongJoon.
Is this how it was going to end?

Was this all done in vain? All that only to end like this?

YongJoon’s steps became faster and faster as he walked towards her. Her shaking eyes pierced through him. YongJoon’s fist went up in the air, but it was shaking so badly that it almost looked like he was waving it.
“Hurry up! I can’t do anything in this state!”

Creaaak. Boom!

“Don’t move, you bastards!”

The door of one of the trailer containers burst open and a blinding light flashed on. They were surrounded by light. YongJoon covered his eyes with his arm to shield his eyes from the blinding light. SungHo did the same.



“Get them!”

They heard a woman shout from inside. EunHa slowly opened her eyes. As she drew in a deep breath, her blurry eyes managed to see Lieutenant Han run towards her. She saw General Manager Cha run out behind her and a group of people in police uniforms swarm out of the trailer containers.
“Lee EunHa-ssi, are you okay?” “What’s going on…”
Frowning, EunHa couldn’t finish her sentence due to the shock of this situation. Lieutenant Han helped her up from the ground.
“You’ve been though a lot. Are you hurt anywhere?” “……”
“I’m sorry for putting you in such a dangerous situation. We’ve managed to obtain Kang SungHo’s confession of murdering your parents 10 years ago, so he won’t be able to worm his way out of this one.”
EunHa slapped away Lieutenant Han’s offered hand and grabbed her jacket instead.
“Why are you here, Lieutenant Han?” “What?”
“How did you know I was here?”

EunHa couldn’t understand how Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha had known about this place. Her muddled head was all over the place.
“…You don’t know?”



Lieutenant Han looked flustered for a moment before she let out a deep sigh.
“It looks like you didn’t know. Then let me explain.”

EunHa looked completely shocked, so Lieutenant Han began to speak in calming voice.
“These trailer containers have been prepared beforehand by Superintendent Shin as lodging for us police.”
“……”

EunHa finally realized what KyungHyun had meant when he told her he wasn’t staying at a hotel. Her lips began to tremble.
“According to the plan, you were supposed to lure Kang SungHo here, Lee EunHa-ssi.”
Those were the final orders that KyungHyun had sent Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha when they had exited the fast food restaurant.
“Superintendent Shin was supposed to protect you during this process, but as you know, things got twisted up in the middle and…”
When EunHa had shot Kang SungHo, Lieutenant Han thought that it was over. She had expected this to happen, so there was no way KyungHyun hadn’t expected the same. Even if she had to receive disciplinary action from her superior officers for this, KyungHyun would receive the same because he was the one leading the operation. Therefore, Lieutenant Han endured it and held back. Additionally, they had managed to obtain Kang SungHo’s confession of committing the murders from 10 years ago thanks to EunHa’s provocation.
“I’m sorry for not saving you sooner, Lee EunHa-ssi.”



Kang SungHo, who had tried to escape by limping away, was now held by General Manager Cha. He whipped his head back and forth as he roared out.
“Let me go! Let go, you bastards!!”

“Kang SungHo, you are under arrest on charges of drug soliciting. As per your confession, you are also charged with the murders of Lee HyunSoo and Yoon MinJung 10 years ago along with arson. There will also be an additional charge of kidnapping a teenage girl. You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law. You have the right to an attorney, and…”
“Drugs?! Drugs…?!! Where’s your proof? You sons of bitches!”
Watching Kang SungHo scream out, General Manager Cha slid his glasses up the bridge of his nose. Then he gave him a sharp glare.
“We found 500 million won’s worth of drugs in your boat.” “Wh…What?”
Kang SungHo’s eyes glazed over in confusion.

“Fuck, what’s going on?!”

YongJoon obediently followed the police in handcuffs as he avoided SungHo’s eyes. Lieutenant Han had followed KyungHyun to China and approached YongJoon last night before General Manager Cha had followed Kang SungHo onto the plane for his departure.
When she heard EunHa and KyungHyun get captured by Im SungJoon through the phone, she immediately began to proceed with another operation. KyungHyun had a knack for preparing a Plan B or even a Plan C in the case that Plan A failed.



“If something happens to me, catch Kang SungHo by using his henchman. If you can’t convince him to join our side, threaten him until he does.”
At first, when Lieutenant Han offered to clear him of his miscellaneous crimes in exchange for joining their side, YongJoon had gone berserk. However, when Kang SungHo had beaten him to a pulp for failing to keep track of Lee EunHa, he had a change of heart.
“Is it okay for the police to do business like a gangster? Are you guys really police?”
Yongjoon grumbled as the police began to move the necessary goods onto Kang SungHo’s boat. Lieutenant Han didn’t deny it. In the case that they failed to catch him smuggling drugs, her superior officer told her that they’d just set the scene for a successful arrest. Her thoughts mirrored YongJoon’s, so she had nothing to say.
“If we want to catch those dirty bastards, we need to be even dirtier.”
KyungHyun had said this jokingly. YongJoon avoided Kang SungHo’s eyes and quickly got into the police cruiser. In handcuffs of his own, Kang SungHo began to shout out.
“You sons of bitches… You stupid bastards!!”

Kang SungHo continued to raise his voice even as he was being taken away in an ambulance.





EunHa looked at Lieutenant Han in confusion and let out a ragged breath.
“So you all waited here in order to capture Kang SungHo?
What about Shin KyungHyun?”

“Superintendent Shin is taking care of matters on Im SungJoon’s side. According to the plan, we were supposed to meet when he was finished.”
EunHa cut off Lieutenant Han’s frustrating words and grabbed her.

“Are you not aware that he is currently in danger? He got caught. He was captured by Im SungJoon and… He’s currently locked up inside the Chinese mafia’s hideout.”
EunHa swallowed back her cries and began to speak incoherently.

“I’m the only one who escaped. The gangsters began to come after us, and I’m the only one who… I’m the only one…”
EunHa finally made a decision and frantically grabbed Lieutenant Han. There was no time to explain.
“We need to go quickly. Let’s go to him. I know where he is.”
It wouldn’t take long to get to him if they took the tunnel she had climbed out of.
“Lee EunHa-ssi, calm down. We need to finish up over here



before we can leave…”
“Is a criminal’s arrest more important than your comrade’s safety?!”
When EunHa screamed, Lieutenant Han looked at her in shock.

“Lee EunHa-ssi.”

EunHa let out a hot breath. She knew. She knew that Lieutenant Han wasn’t the one who deserved her anger.
“…I’m sorry.”

EunHa muttered and bit her lip. A tear began to trickle down from her eye. The confusing puzzle began to all come together in her head.
When KyungHyun had sent her away on her own, he already knew what would happen. He knew that she would go looking for Kang SungHo as soon as she escaped. He also knew that she would be in danger as she faced off with Kang SungHo. So when he gave her a chance to execute her revenge, he also made sure that she stayed safe.
Having finally realized this, a sob burst out of EunHa’s mouth. Covered behind her tangled hair, tears began to run down her cheeks.
“EunHa-ssi, are you alright?”

She couldn’t hold back her emotions anymore. She wouldn’t be able to see him ever again. Lieutenant Han looked helpless as she watched EunHa sob.
“EunHa-ssi…”

Although Lieutenant Han had only met EunHa a handful of times,



every time she had seen her, EunHa always came across as a powerful woman. Seeing EunHa shed tears as she cried sadly, Lieutenant Han didn’t know what to do. EunHa opened her mouth and began to stutter.
“In order to have my revenge, I ran away without looking back. That man even gave me the gun and stayed behind all because of me. Even though I knew he’d be in danger, I ran away all by myself.”
Humans were all selfish. And she was no different. Until now, she had lived her life that way, and she had no regrets. However, not anymore. Even though she shot Kang SungHo, even though she watched him get arrested, she didn’t feel any better. Having her revenge by sacrificing another… She realized that she didn’t want to have anything to do with it. But it was too late now.
“Lee EunHa-ssi.”

Lieutenant Han tried to calm her down, but EunHa looked up at her with her bloodied face and begged her.
“You need to go there. That man… hurry up and save him…”
EunHa already knew it was too late. Even so, she didn’t think she could stand doing nothing.
“What do I do…? If that man is dead, what am I supposed to do from now on? I feel so sorry. How can I live with myself…?”
EunHa mumbled to herself as her voice trembled with her sobs. She felt as if her vision was going dark and her head was spinning. She would never love another man in this lifetime. She knew that there would be no other man strong enough to capture her in this world.



Kshhh.

Lieutenant Han was shocked as she held EunHa up, keeping her from collapsing onto the ground. General Manager Cha stood next to her and gestured to the walkie-talkie in his hand with his eyes. Lieutenant Han finally took off her bluetooth microphone and took out her walkie-talkie from her back pocket.
“Did you hear that?”

No sound came from the device. Lieutenant Han looked annoyed and opened her mouth once again.
“If you heard it, please say something. Over.”

Her boss, who had overheard all this through General Manager Cha’s walkie-talkie, finally answered.
⦁	Ah, it was just getting good.
EunHa’s sobs suddenly stopped when she heard the voice through the small device.
⦁	You have a terrible personality, Lieutenant Han.
EunHa’s wet eyes burst open. Her dilated pupils began to shake furiously. She felt as if a fog had lifted.
⦁	You could have just told her quickly. Now you’ve gone and made the kid cry.
The staticky voice coming from the walkie-talkie was definitely KyungHyun’s voice.
“Hello?!”

EunHa burst up and snatched the walkie-talkie from Lieutenant Han’s hand.



“Hello? Are you… Are you okay?”
EunHa shouted into the device, her voice still filled with tears.
EunHa chewed on her lip as she continued to raise her voice.

“Hello?! Shin KyungHyun! Are you really okay?! Answer me!!”
“EunHa-ssi, you need to press this button when you speak in order to…”
“What? Wha… What do I do?”

As Lieutenant Han kindly tried to show her what to do, EunHa looked confused as she tried to focus. Because of this, she didn’t realize that someone was approaching her from behind.
“Wouldn’t it be faster to check if someone’s okay or not with your own eyes?”
EunHa froze. The voice that was slowly coming closer was definitely KyungHyun’s. She quickly turned around. Her cloudy eyes finally saw his face so clearly. He was alive. He was bloody and bruised all over, but he was definitely walking over here just fine.
“……!”

She burst out of her seat and ran to him. KyungHyun grabbed her hips and pulled her to his chest. EunHa screamed as he held her to him.
“I thought you had died… I thought you were dead!” “Why would I die?”
Embracing her, KyungHyun asked her with a laugh. EunHa felt it was more unbelievable that he had managed to fend for himself against a swarm of men who held guns and knives.



“A gunshot… I heard a gunshot. You didn’t have a gun. You weren’t holding anything.”
“I told you before. I can come out victorious in any brawl.”

EunHa clenched his bloody, torn shirt. She had so many things to say to him, but she couldn’t put it into words. So she just took a deep, ragged breath instead.
“Do you think I’m some kind of rookie or something?”

His forehead was covered in blood splatters. His bloody face came closer and closer to hers. His lips moved as he asked the question, gradually arching into a smile.
“Were you that sad and sorry because you thought I’d died?”
She tried to deny it, but she couldn’t. With an expression mixed with relief and resentment, EunHa merely nodded. Seeing this, KyungHyun whispered.
“You look prettier than usual today.”

EunHa’s face flushed as she gave him a reproachful look. She didn’t have to look in a mirror to know that she looked like an absolute mess right now.
“Ah, I can’t take it anymore.”

KyungHyun brought his lips to her dirty, bloody, and bruised face. It looked like this man wanted a kiss in a situation like this. She was right.
“Hmm…!”

His tongue greedily tangled with hers. Surprisingly, all the tension and worries faded away from her body like smoke. A few more tears



trickled down EunHa’s face as she pulled him closer. Their breaths mixed together. He was alive. This man was really alive. KyungHyun nibbled on her lips and swallowed her mouth. He wrapped his arms around her hips.
“…I wish you would hold onto me like this whenever we kiss from now on.”
KyungHyun cut off the string of saliva between their mouths with his tongue and whispered in a husky voice. His arm was still keeping her body stuck close to his.
“If you keep looking at me like that, I feel like I can go back there and do it all over again in the nude if you told me to.”
“Stop speaking nonsense.” “I’m serious.”
Just the thought of it made EunHa frown. KyungHyun softly caressed her cheek as if to comfort her. As he tilted his head back down to hers, EunHa blocked him. She grabbed him as she looked at him with trembling eyes.
“…How did you get out of there? Did you fight off hundreds of men on your own?”
“Kind of. Back-up came just in time.”

The police began raiding the scene right when Im SungJoon handed over the money and Li Kahui prepared the goods. The back-up arrived just as KyungHyun finished off the ninth Chinese gangster, completely drenched in blood.
If they had arrived any later, KyungHyun would have been in a precarious situation. This was because Im SungJoon had begun to charge at him with a knife. Thanks to the raid, the site of the transaction had plunged into chaos. And thanks to the Chinese police



force, Li Kahui was also arrested on site.

“Take that bastard Shin KyungHyun too, you Chinese bastards!”
Even though KyungHyun and his team were cooperating with the Chinese police force, the Chinese police were known to be extremely difficult to work with. However, it seemed that even they acknowledged KyungHyun’s role in this operation. KyungHyun received the handcuffs and began to walk over to Im SungJoon. Im SungJoon looked at him with an expression he had never seen before.
“Fuck… You were a cop? A cop?! Shin KyungHyun, you son of a bitch!!”
Even as he was being handcuffed, Im SungJoon seemed to deny reality as he roared. EunHa looked at KyungHyun’s face as he recalled what had happened.
“How did they know… that you were over there?”

KyungHyun grinned and took her hand. He placed it on the back of his neck. She felt a small bump the size of a grain of rice against her fingers. EunHa looked at him with a peculiar expression.
“I lived with something like that buried in my body for 12 years. It came in handy a few times before.”
A GPS body chip needed to be replaced periodically. And now, he would never have to do that again. EunHa swallowed her sigh of relief and looked at him with narrowed eyes.
“Why didn’t you tell me?” “There wasn’t time to tell you.” “…I was worried.”



“I know. That’s why I’m in a good mood.”

EunHa pounded his chest with her fist. He didn’t even know how she felt and continued to say things like that. KyungHyun grunted at the impact and his brows furrowed. She saw his expression change as she felt something warm on her hand. Shocked, EunHa pushed him away. She looked back and forth between her wet hand and KyungHyun, her face full of worry.
“You’re bleeding!”

She shouted when she finally discovered the bloody bandage wrapped underneath his shirt. Now that she had a good look at him, she realized that KyungHyun was a total, bloody mess.
“I only need about twenty stitches.” “Were you stabbed?”
“I’m fine.”

He didn’t mention that he had almost been beheaded by an axe as he was fighting the men barehanded. EunHa glared at him, her eyes full of concern. When KyungHyun met her eyes, his heart began to race inside his chest.
She looked so lovable to him, flustered with worry. He could finally understand what people meant when they said small animals were cute.
“You’re not fine at all…”

EunHa bit her bottom lip to the point of pain as she looked at him with reproach.
“Let’s quickly go the hospital. Hurry.” “This is more urgent right now.”



He swallowed her lips once again as she tried to push him away. Dawn was breaking in the sky of the harbor. A line of police cars and ambulances entered the bustling scene, sirens blaring. The long night was over, and the dark night sky was gradually brightening.
“Today’s headline. The police have issued an arrest warrant for Kim MinSuk, the mayor of Seoul. Video footage of a close aid of Mayor Kim entering the private room of Noh HyungChul, the leader of the major criminal organization ‘YongSung’, has been released in various portal sites and shared throughout the country. It looks like an investigation can no longer be delayed. In the video, the conversation between Mayor Kim’s aide, Mr. Song, and Mr. Noh reveals a history of bribery and embezzlement which began years ago when Mr. Kim ran for a position in the ruling party’s National Assembly. In an emergency press conference this morning, Seoul Mayor Kim stated that this was a political attack coming from his opponents due to the imminent election and that he was going to face the political scandal head-on.”
Lieutenant Han sat opposite of EunHa. She gazed at EunHa, who was currently looking out the window. Lieutenant Han opened her mouth and began to speak.
“Lee EunHa-ssi, this is your new ID card and passport.”

Like a cat basking in the sun, EunHa continued to languidly look out the window as she listened to Lieutenant Han’s explanations. They had covered up the fact that she had shot Kang SungHo from their superiors. Thanks to that, they told her that she was no longer going to be questioned in this investigation. It was an undue result of helping finish this operation that had dragged its feet for over 10 years to clean up the city of crime.
“There shouldn’t be any obstacles for you if you plan on leaving the country. Now all you need to do is live the life you’ve always wanted to live.”



“The weather’s quite nice today. It doesn’t feel like winter.”
Instead of answering Lieutenant Han, EunHa stretched her neck to the side as she smiled at her.
“Yes, it is.”

Lieutenant Han lifted her coffee cup. The ring on her fourth finger sparkled as it reflected the winter sun. After taking some time off, Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha… no, he had been promoted to Inspector Cha JoongWon… had finally settled on a date to get married. Lieutenant Han had also been praised for her own performance and was promoted to team leader.
“Ah, also…”

Lieutenant Han handed her something that looked like a car key.

“This as well.”

“Are you seriously giving me a car?”
She’d rather have taken money instead… EunHa thought jokingly.
Lieutenant Han shrugged.

“Superintendent Shin was the one who prepared this.”

After completing his undercover mission, KyungHyun made a grand return to the police force. After booking Mayor Kim MinSuk and YongSung leader Noh HyungChul, KyungHyun was busy digging out all of the illegal businesses run by Serim one by one. He was so busy every single day that even EunHa had a hard time seeing his face these days.
“I think that man likes me too much. If he’s like this, it causes the recipient to feel exhausted. But he doesn’t even know that and continues to suffocate me.”



Even though EunHa said this in jest, Lieutenant Han didn’t laugh and brush it off. Instead, she looked at EunHa and asked.
“Isn’t it the same for you, EunHa-ssi?” “What?”
“From how I see it, I don’t think your feelings for Superintendent Shin are that much smaller.”
At Lieutenant Han’s soft reply, EunHa was at a loss for words. Then she nodded her head.
“I guess that’s true. That’s why it’s quite tiring.”

“I don’t think Superintendent Shin is the type of man to get tired of something like that.”
EunHa smiled bitterly and shook her head.

“No. I was talking about myself. I’m tiring myself out.”

Lieutenant Han glanced at EunHa. EunHa kept silent for a while before she shrugged her shoulders and continued nonchalantly.
“To be honest, I… I never thought there’d come a day when a man made my heart twist. You may think that it’s quite cocky of me to say this, but…”
EunHa lowered her voice.

“It’s been that way until now.”

EunHa never wanted to go through the emotions she had felt when she thought KyungHyun had died ever again. A sense of loss, fear, and loneliness. These emotions took over her body and made it almost insufferable.
Now that she had returned to a normal life, she felt this even more.



KyungHyun was now a man busy with many things. When EunHa realized that she was the one waiting for his call every time, she almost didn’t recognize herself. During the series of events they had gone through together, a man named Shin KyungHyun had completely captured her heart. That much was true.
Once everything was over, her emotions showed no sign of ending along with it. She thought her feelings couldn’t possibly grow any bigger, but it was still growing, and it scared her.
Ever since she had grown up, she had only looked out for herself. However, a man with a huge presence had cut in and was now taking over. She was scared that she would begin to completely lean on him at this rate.
It was true that she had wanted to get to know him better, and that hadn’t changed. However, she felt that if he ever hurt her, she wouldn’t be able to recover from it.
“Just… things like love and dating… I just feel that it doesn’t suit someone like me.”
Before Lieutenant Han could say anything, EunHa picked up her luggage and got up from her seat.
“But I’ll gladly take this.”

She would just think of it as his last gift to her. Knowing that the man she liked didn’t have an empty wallet gave her a touch of comfort.
“He said that you can just throw it away if you don’t like it.”
“Ey, of course not.”

EunHa happily looked down at the car key and gazed at the glimmering logo of a famous car brand.



“Where’s the car?”

“Over there by the riverside.”

As they came out into the garden, a Lieutenant Han’s large dog jumped up with joy. EunHa bent down and began to stroke the dog’s soft fur. Behind her, Lieutenant Han suddenly spoke up.
“There’s nothing in this world that isn’t suitable.” “……”
“An undeserved joy or happiness that one mustn’t pursue… There’s no such thing like that in this world, EunHa-ssi.”
Lieutenant Han felt that EunHa was happy and that she was afraid of losing that happiness. In some ways, she was probably correct.
Kang SungHo was in prison to pay for his crimes, and there was no longer any need for EunHa to put herself in danger. KyungHyun was busy, but every time they met, he fiercely embraced her as he whispered sweet nothings in her ear.
She experienced this ‘normal life’ she’d never had before, and her heart throbbed, bringing her as close to happiness as she’d ever been. The problem was that EunHa was afraid to accept this normal life.
“Thank you for the kind words.”

This was probably going to be the last time she saw Lieutenant Han. EunHa grinned at her. Suddenly, a question popped into her head. EunHa hesitated for a moment before she decided to ask Lieutenant Han this question.
“There’s something I’ve always wanted to as you…” “Go ahead.”



“If I ask, will you give me an answer?” “If I can give you an answer, I’ll do it.”
Lieutenant Han gave her a comfortable smile and nodded her head.
“Back then, in China…” “Yes?”
“Why didn’t you arrest Kang SungHo sooner?” “……”
“After Kang SungHo admitted to the crimes he committed 10 years ago, you could have arrested him right then and there. I mean, I thought that’s what you’d do, but you just watched as I shot Kang SungHo.”
Lieutenant Han remained silent for a moment. The wind blew her hair astray, so she lightly swept it back as she opened her mouth to answer.
“Because I’m still a human and a woman before I’m a member of the police.”
“……”

“I thought he was a man who deserved more than death. I’m sure Inspector Cha and Superintendent Shin also felt the same.”
Lieutenant Han gave EunHa a faint smile. EunHa silently met her eyes and gave her a smile back before she bowed and turned around. Lieutenant Han watched EunHa’s back as she walked further and further away. However, she didn’t call her to stop. Either way, this was all something EunHa needed to figure out on her own.



It was a quite neighborhood with no one around. EunHa walked slowly, stepping on the dry grass. The car Lieutenant Han had mentioned was parked on the riverbank of a serene river that was sparkling under the sunlight.
What the hell.

A white puff left her lips as she let out a forced laugh.

She looked at the well-known brand logo on the car, but all of her expectations had flown out the window. The car was an old model, and she wouldn’t have driven it even if someone paid her. It was completely rundown.
Was this his new way of joking around with her? She couldn’t help but laugh. Would the engine even start in this thing? EunHa decided to find out. She opened the driver-side door but suddenly froze.
“Breaking news. In the middle of the night, the leader of the violent organization ‘Serim’ has escaped his escort vehicle as he was being transferred to a detention center after his arrest. The police have sent out a search party of about a hundred men in order to find out Mr. Kang’s whereabouts. They are asking the residents of the area to take caution and cooperate…”
The anchor’s steady voice recited the news on the radio. In the driver’s seat, Kang SungHo was handcuffed in a prison uniform, tape covering his lips. He was securely tied to the seat. She could obviously tell that he hadn’t escaped on his own. She couldn’t tell what he was saying as he screamed. Kang SungHo’s bloodshot eyes looked up at her pleadingly.
“……”

EunHa raised her hand and ripped off the tape covering his mouth. Paying no attention to his smarting mouth, Kang SungHo quickly



called out to her.

“EunHa, can you untie me? Hmm? EunHa, Princess, hurry.”

There pungent smell coming from inside the car. EunHa took in a short breath and frowned. She looked over to the passenger side and saw a white gasoline tank. There was nothing else inside the car. She finally realized that this strong smell was coming from the car which had been doused with gasoline.
“Let’s start from the very beginning. You and me. Let’s start over. Ahjussi will treat you well. EunHa!”
“…How will you treat me well?”

As soon as EunHa asked, Kang SungHo looked like he’d been thrown a lifeline in a desolate sea. He looked at her and raised his voice.
“Anything! I’ll do anything you want…!” “What do you think I want from you, Ahjussi?”
EunHa asked him as she looked down at him meaningfully. Kang SungHo’s eyes shook. He realized that he had said the wrong thing and began to stutter.
“Y-You said so yourself. That Serim was the only home you could return to. I’m the same. I lived my life for the good of Serim. I wanted to make our organization stronger so that we could do whatever we wanted! I loved you in my own way. I wanted to create a sturdy home that could keep you safe. So I did whatever I could to make that happen.”
“You loved me?”

EunHa asked softly as she gazed at him.



“Yeah…!”
Kang SungHo nodded violently. His limp hair also gave off the smell of gasoline. Almost as if someone had poured gasoline over his head until he was completely drenched. EunHa didn’t have to think too hard to figure out who this person was.
“I’ll let you have your revenge. I’ll capture Kang SungHo and bring him to you.”
EunHa smiled bitterly as she realized that this man, who was just as stubborn as her, had ultimately kept his word. KyungHyun could have killed him right away, but he didn’t. And the reason he didn’t do that was because he wanted to leave the choice in her hands. And it didn’t take EunHa very long to make up her mind.
“All right, Ahjussi. I’ll consider our past relationship and help you out just this once.”
EunHa laughed softly. SungHo’s scarred brow twisted as he looked at her like a child. A thin stream of tears began to trickle down from his eye. A glimmer of hope flashed through his pupils as he watched EunHa with joy. EunHa continued on.
“This long, unrequited love of yours… I’ll end it for you.”

EunHa whispered sweetly into his ears. She stuck the tape back over his mouth. SungHo began to scream, but EunHa didn’t understand what he was saying. She felt that it was only natural that she couldn’t understand the groans of a beast.
Click.

She closed the car door and slowly walked away. Then she opened her purse. She took out her last cigarette and lit it. She took a drag and exhaled, and the smoke flew away with the cold, winter wind. The sun was shining, and there was no person in sight. Every time the wind blew, she heard the rustle of dry grass.



EunHa chuckled softly as she savored her cigarette. After this cigarette, she felt that she could quit smoking.
Whoosh.

The finished cigarette flew away with the wind. It lightly fell onto the roof of the car Kang SungHo was trapped in. The small embers of the cigarette traveled down the car. It only took a moment for the whole car to burst into flames.
EunHa began to run with all her might in her slick heels. She wasn’t going to look back anymore. She said this to herself as she laughed joyfully like a child.







“I heard lawyers encounter all sorts of people, but this is really interesting. I thought this kind of thing only happened in movies.”
“Sometimes, reality can be even crazier than movies.” “I think you’re right, especially in today’s day and age.”
The man couldn’t take his eyes off of EunHa as he smiled softly. His throat was sore from talking so much. EunHa lifted her glass and gulped down its contents. Then she met the surprised eyes of the man sitting next to her and lowered her glass of liquor.
“I’m usually terrible with alcohol, but seeing as how you’re listening to me with so much interest, I couldn’t help but get excited.”
“Drink as much as you’d like. It’s the least I can do for someone who will be my asset consultant.”
EunHa swept back her black hair and smiled at him with a flushed face.
“What if I want to meet you for more personal reasons?” “Sorry?”
Seeing the blatant desire flash in his surprised eyes, EunHa replied cheerfully.
“I’m usually on the more professional side when I’m



working. If we begin talking about business, you might find me less likable.”
“There’s no way that will happen.”

EunHa’s new business associate tried to feign nonchalance as he shook his head.
“Sometimes I have clients who avoid me because they don’t feel comfortable revealing such personal details about themselves. But since I’m their lawyer, if I don’t know my clients completely, I won’t be able to do my work properly.”
“You’re completely right.”

“Thank you for being so understanding.”

EunHa raised her glass to him as her eyes narrowed with laughter. As her glass gradually emptied, she noticed how his eyes began to linger on her. EunHa opened her mouth and began to speak.
“So you’re currently doing your best to avoid the inheritance tax, right?”
“Yes, that’s right.”

“How much is your parents’ assets worth? Including all the cash, real estate, and any secret funds kept in foreign countries.”
EunHa listened to his reply and stretched out her hand to take another sip of her cocktail. However, her heart was racing inside her chest and she felt like spitting out a curse.
“If it’s worth that much, I think…”

EunHa kept a cautious expression on her face and counted to five inside her head before she continued. It was always important to



take things slow. Now that she was in a foreign country, she couldn’t afford to lose such a big catch.
[Excuse me.]

Damn it.

The bartender had to pick this moment to clear her empty glass and replace it with another one even though she didn’t ask. EunHa decided to take this as a sign from the heavens to relax and take things slow. She did her best to grin at him.
[What is this? Is this on the house?] [This is a Manhattan.]
EunHa nodded as she raised the glass filled with a brilliant liquor.

“It suits this place perfectly. Do you know about the origins of this cocktail?”
“No, I don’t think I quite know…”

EunHa gave him an alluring smile as she watched him gaze at her.

“Ah, this is just something I heard in a bar I frequent. They say there was a Native American chieftain in America who was drunk when he handed over all of Manhattan…”
EunHa’s voice matched the mood as she carefully began to explain.
“They say that this cocktail is perfectly suited for a con artist.”
When she heard a voice cut in from behind, EunHa’s brows furrowed. The man next to her turned around to take a look at this unwelcome guest. KyungHyun didn’t look at him and continued to gaze at EunHa as he grinned.



“It’s been a while.”
“Excuse me. Who are you to suddenly…”

The man began to raise his voice in indignation when KyungHyun reached into his coat pocket. When he took his hand out, he was holding a pair of silver handcuffs that clinked cheerfully. He placed them on top of the bar table.
“It’s truly a wonderful coincidence to meet another Korean here. May I share the table with you?”
The man cautiously began to get up from his seat. He didn’t even offer EunHa an explanation and coughed awkwardly before leaving. EunHa looked around with a bewildered expression. YongJoon, who had been sitting at a table not too far from them, was nowhere in sight. He had realized what was going on and fled the scene.
That cheap bastard. After leaving Serim, he set up a detective agency and tried to make some money by catching adulterers in the act and taking photos of them. EunHa felt stupid for bringing this kind of guy to the United States, but it was too late to regret it now.
“Thanks to you, I took a month off work.”

KyungHyun looked at her with narrowed eyes as he smiled at her. He sat down in the man’s empty seat and ordered a martini. It was inevitable. He had to take time off in order to find EunHa, who had suddenly left the country and fled to the United States.
“Um… You don’t have to thank me. You’ve been working so much lately, so I think it’s nice to take some time off to relax…”
Bewildered, KyungHyun didn’t know what to say. He grabbed her hand as she continued to ramble on.
“Do you seriously want to die?”



KyungHyun met EunHa’s eyes and asked her in a soft voice. When he came back to the apartment they’d been sharing, he was devastated to find that all her luggage had disappeared. He felt that if he scolded her too much right now, she’d run away again, so he hid his anxiety behind a relaxed expression.
“You can’t even kill me anyways.”
“But I can keep you locked away for the rest of your life.” “You’re not a gangster anymore. You’re police. You
shouldn’t do that.”

“Are you trying to torture me?”

This man still couldn’t take a joke. He lifted his index finger and began stroke her cheek. His languid voice and his familiar movements made her blush.
“I even took care of that rundown car for you, so why did you run away?”
He was talking about the incident with Kang SungHo. EunHa settled her racing heart and smiled at him.
“I don’t find it attractive when a man treats me too well.” KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed as a puff of air escaped his lips. “Well, you probably haven’t dated in a long time, so you
might have forgotten about this. But when it comes to
dating, there’s such a thing as push and pull. You need this in order for your dating life to stay exciting, but Shin KyungHyun-ssi is too good to me, so it’s a bit boring.”
“Stop joking around.”

KyungHyun saw through her lie as his eyes pierced through her. He



outlined her lips with his finger, causing her mouth to go dry.

“You don’t believe me?”

“Whenever you lie, you start to ramble. It’s cute.”

KyungHyun sweet voice caused her heart to race. This was the first time she had seen his face in a month. Her heart suddenly throbbed inside her chest as if she were a young girl.
“Is it because you’re afraid?” It was as if he’d read her heart. “Of what?”
“Are you afraid because you came to like me? That I might disappoint you? Until now, no one has gotten close enough to hurt you, so are you afraid that I might be the first one?”
EunHa was still smiling, but she began to bite her lips, revealing her anxious thoughts. Maybe it was because of his older age, but this man wasn’t someone she could underestimate.
“If that is the case, what are you going to do about it?” “What am I going to do? I’m going to keep going at it until
you change your mind.”

His straightforward answer almost seemed to mock the worries she had been stewing over on her own. KyungHyun’s answer was simple and clear.
“If you run away again, I’ll just catch you again.” “……”
A faint laugh unintentionally escaped EunHa’s lips.



“How straightforward of you.”

“There’s nothing complicated about it. In this short life, we just need to focus on enjoying each others’ company.”
EunHa’s eyelashes fluttered at his words as she blinked once or twice. That’s right. In this short life, worrying about things that hadn’t even happened was just a waste of energy.
“All right, then.” “What?”
“Let’s try dating seriously.”

KyungHyun’s lips arched into a satisfied smile.

“Good choice.”

However, before she made it official, there were a few things she wanted to say. She felt that she could say at least this much if she was going to reveal her true self to him.
“But I have a few conditions.” “Tell me.”
Her slender fingers gripped his shoulder. Her faint touch didn’t fail to arouse the man, who began to lick his dry lips. EunHa gazed at him as she hesitated before opening her lips.
“From now on, don’t work so hard.”

His job put him in situations where he had to risk his life. If he got hurt, she didn’t have the confidence to face it. EunHa carefully explained herself.
“I hate having to worry about my man getting hurt.”



Instead of replying, KyungHyun narrowed his eyes as he gave her a silent smile. His dangerous, languid smile caused EunHa’s hand to dampen with sweat.
“And don’t smile at other women like that.”

KyungHyun’s eyes pierced into her as he took the olive from his martini and began to slowly chew it. The languid movements of his jaw seemed sensual because it reminded EunHa of the way it moved when he put her soft skin in his mouth.
“I’m normally very greedy and very jealous. If you ever cheat on me with another woman, I’m going to kill you both.”
EunHa rolled her large eyes as her voice trembled at the end of her sentence. Her pale face had gone completely red.
“Can you say something? Don’t just stare at me like that.
You’re making me feel stupid.”

“If I keep those two conditions, you’ll stay by my side for the rest of your life?”
KyungHyun, who had been listening to her silently, placed his glass down and asked.
“What?”

EunHa’s large eyes blinked rapidly. She noticed this happening before, but wasn’t there a huge gap between her conditions and his? And yet he said it as if it was nothing.
“I won’t die in the line of duty, I swear to you. And I obviously won’t smile at another woman who isn’t you. There won’t even be an instance where I speak more than three words to another woman. As you well know, I don’t have a personality that women tend to like.”



“…There are strange women out there who like stiff and arrogant men. Like me.”
“So if you make a man like me yours, it will only help our situation.”
KyungHyun faintly laughed. EunHa couldn’t tell if he was joking or being serious.
“I accepted your conditions. So you also need to do something for me. There’s no going back. Once you’re all-in, that’s it.”
“…I seriously don’t think my words are getting through to you.”
“Let’s kiss.”

KyungHyun wrapped his hand around her cheek and whispered.

“Excuse me. We’re from the polite country of Korea, and doing it in a public place is…”
“We’ve fucked in an alleyway with my pants down, so why does it matter?”
“You’ve returned to the police force, so please watch your language…”
His face came closer to her unwilling one. His lips pressed onto hers, effectively cutting her off. Their body heats mingled together. Her refusal to give in to his stubbornness only lasted 1 second. As soon as KyungHyun began to suck on her lower lip, her body melted.
KyungHyun moved her hand from his shoulder and wrapped her arms around his neck. Then he plunged even deeper into her mouth and began to suck. After their wet kiss came to an end, EunHa panted as she gazed at him. Her bright pink lipstick was smeared all



over his lips, but the man still dripped sex appeal as he looked back at her.
“I’ve pulled out the rug from under you several times, but do you still like me that much?”
“I do.”

“Why?”

“A con artist and a cop have high compatibility. I even heard from someone that our sexual compatibility is amazing.”
EunHa drew in a deep breath and looked at him. Even if she ran away again, this man would find her without fail. It would be difficult to lose him from now on. She felt that it wouldn’t be so bad to give in to fate and just go with the flow.
“You definitely said that I can run away again if I feel like it, right?”
“Yeah, but not tonight.”

EunHa met his eyes and softly whispered.

“Why not?”

“You really don’t know?”

His breaths were heavy. EunHa’s eyes began to sparkle.

“I don’t know.”

“I better handcuff you again.”
“…If I give you a kiss, will you let me off just this once?” “We’ll see.”



KyungHyun’s blazing eyes gazed at her as he answered in a husky voice. EunHa’s face approached his and her lips were furiously swallowed once again. Their tongues tangled in this deep kiss, causing an electric current to run down her body. She felt his body heat through her evening dress, and the fine hairs on her body stood up on edge. EunHa placed her hand on his chest. Her finger grazed against his Adam’s apple, causing it to bob up and down.
“Put the handcuffs on me in bed.” “…Whatever you want.”
The world’s sexiest man looked at her as he smiled arrogantly. He reached inside his suit jacket pocket and pulled out a suite room card. He held it between his fingers and waved it at her.
Beep.

As soon as the hotel door opened, they threw themselves into a scorching kiss. He lifted her into his arms and proceeded to walk to the bedroom. EunHa’s arms were wrapped around his neck, and the top of her dress had been shoved down her shoulders at some point.
“Slowly… Do it slowly.” “I don’t think I can.”
KyungHyun let out a ragged breath as he lowered her body onto the mattress. He roughly pulled at his necktie and tossed it onto the floor. His hot lips fell on EunHa’s trembling breast. He grasped her breast and began to suck, causing shivers to run down her skin. EunHa’s shoulders shook slightly as she felt his familiar touch. Her body still remembered the pleasure that was to come.
“You must have a lot piled up.” “Yeah. Thanks to someone.”



EunHa felt his erection harden against her thigh. KyungHyun continued to nibble on her peak as his hands fondled her underneath the dress. He hurriedly lowered her tiny panties. He was just about to lower his lips onto her drenched, aromatic entrance when EunHa twisted her hips away.
“What’s wrong?”

KyungHyun frowned as he began to push her thighs apart. EunHa put her foot on his shoulder and pushed him back.
“I want to do it too.” “Do what?”
Unable to suppress his arousal, KyungHyun’s voice sounded rough and hoarse. His lips pressed onto her calf as he licked it.
“I want to suck it. Suck you.”

KyungHyun’s black eyes were filled with desire as they raked over her. He didn’t ask twice. He unbuckled his belt and pulled off his pants and underwear in one breath. After tossing them away, he lied down on the bed and grabbed her legs and pulled.
“Aah…!”

EunHa found herself kneeling on all fours as she caught her balance. Standing straight up through the forest of pubic hair, KyungHyun’s penis was right before her eyes. His grotesque cock didn’t seem to match his sculpted face. It bobbed up and down in front of her face.
“Haa…!”

Before she could organize her thoughts, she felt him suck her. The man’s lips greedily dug into her entrance. The wet sounds grew louder, making her feel embarrassed. Her entrance throbbed as a



slick fluid began to flow out. When KyungHyun began to poke his tongue in and out, EunHa put his cock into her mouth.
“Hmm…!”

His penis was a lot bigger than it looked. It completely filled her mouth. EunHa began to suck, and she instantly felt KyungHyun’s thigh harden underneath her fingers. She felt his ragged breaths against her sensitive skin. EunHa was sure he felt the same as her breaths brushed against his cock.
“Hm…! Hnng…!”

KyungHyun’s tongue began to dig into her folds it penetrated her. Every place he licked and sucked caused a current of pleasure to spread throughout her body. Precum was trickling down from the head of KyungHyun’s cock. EunHa’s face was flushed with desire. Judging from the way KyungHyun’s hips were rising up and down, he was in the same state.
“Hm…! Hnng…!”

KyungHyun grasped her legs and pulled them apart. Then he dug his face into her and mercilessly pushed apart her folds with his tongue. With his penis still lodged firmly inside, a mixture of cum and saliva began to trickle out of her mouth. Pleasure rose up from below, and his penis was pumping into her mouth as it did when they had sex. EunHa had finally reached the tipping point and couldn’t take it anymore.
“Enough… Ah, no more…”

EunHa pulled his penis out and gasped for breath. She wrapped her hand around his cock and began to stroke it. KyungHyun kept his arms wrapped around her thighs and didn’t think to let them go as he lifted his head.
“Are you trying to make me to come before we begin?”



EunHa felt that it would be better that way. When she first had sex with him, the night felt like a war zone. She clearly remembered this and unintentionally raised her voice.
“Yes… Hng!”

Before she could finish her sentence, semen began to spurt out his cock. EunHa’s eyes widened. He continued to ejaculate aggressively as his warm semen drenched her hand. As soon as he let go, KyungHyun let out a ragged breath and climbed on top of her.
“Wait, let me wash my hand first…” KyungHyun softly grasped her wrist. “We both need a fair start.”
He placed her hand on top of her drenched entrance that he had sucked just moments before. EunHa finally realized what it was that he wanted as he looked at her with his languid eyes.
“Show me.”

KyungHyun covered EunHa’s hand and slowly began to move it. EunHa felt the warm, slippery skin underneath her fingertips. Her clitoris began to twitch from the stimulation. EunHa looked at KyungHyun with narrowed eyes and slowly moved her fingers. With her hand still covered in KyungHyun’s semen, EunHa began to pleasure herself. Black fireworks went off behind KyungHyun’s eyes as he watched her.
“Fuck…”

A curse left KyungHyun’s mouth as he licked his lips. He could feel her ragged breaths brush against the tip of his nose. EunHa whispered in a trembling voice.
“You told me to do it on my own. Should I stop?”



“…Keep going.” “Aaah…”
Her hips began to undulate. EunHa’s tongue tangled with his as she enjoyed the sensations running through her body. This was the first time she was pleasuring herself in front of someone else. Watching her stimulate herself only served to arouse KyungHyun even more. His eyes darkened dangerously. Suddenly, a moan escaped EunHa’s lips as she was just about to reach her climax.
“Hnng!”

KyungHyun snatched her wrist and climbed on top of her. His erect cock entered her in one smooth stroke. Her walls throbbed as they welcomed his intrusion, sucking him in even further.
“Aah! Haa!”

KyungHyun began thrusting immediately. Without any time to adjust to his sudden penetration, EunHa felt her climax approach. EunHa’s slick legs wrapped around his hips.
“Aah…!”

She felt as if she was being rammed by a bulldozer. Her vision turned white. Fireworks burst inside her head and her lower abdomen twitched. Her heart thumped violently inside her chest, but KyungHyun didn’t stop his movements. His rough, husky voice entered her ears.
“Even if you do it by yourself, can’t you beg me to put my cock inside you?”
“Hng, aahng!”

The man continued to mutter such ridiculous things, but she couldn’t pay it any attention. His pubic bone continued to bump into



her clitoris, and the veins of his cock rubbed up against her walls. An electrifying climax burst inside her body as she was continuously pressed down into the bed.
“I’m came… I already came… Aagh!”

“Then we’re back on equal grounds. Now we can start over together.”
KyungHyun’s strained voice entered her ears, not giving her a chance to tell him that she wanted to stop. KyungHyun sucked on her flushed earlobe. The tingling remnants of her climax hummed throughout her body as KyungHyun left red kiss marks on her skin.
The sound of their slapping bodies continued to fill the room with no end in sight. Her lower body, which had felt numb after her climax, began to react once again. When her walls tightly gripped him, KyungHyun lifted his head and let out a low groan.
“I’m going crazy.” “Haa… Me… Me too.” “Try taking in all of me.”
She was already filled to the brim, so she didn’t know what he was talking about. EunHa lifted her hips and wrapped her legs around KyungHyun’s waist. Suddenly, KyungHyun hugged her to his chest and lifted her upright.
“Hng!”

Sitting on top of his sturdy thighs, EunHa felt a zing of pleasure run down her spine. With his knees bent, KyungHyun began to move her up and down. She didn’t know how he was able to lift her up and down as if she were a piece of paper.
“Aahng! Nng!”



KyungHyun pulled her bouncing breast into his mouth. He began to nibble on her peak, and the sting only added to the pleasure. The sound of their slapping bodies rang in the air as EunHa’s voluptuous bottom slammed down on KyungHyun’s hips. Slap, slap. Every time he pounded into her sweet spot, a shrill moan burst out of her lips.
“Aaah!”

EunHa’s hands gripped his head. He lifted his face with a strained expression. His eyes were filled with a dangerous combination of arousal and desire. She was able to read his heart as she looked into them.
“Don’t push me away.”

His face clearly showed how much he was holding back for her. EunHa knew very well how self-centered Shin KyungHyun was in the past. And this man was now lowering his head only for her. This unbelievable fact aroused EunHa even more.
“If the thought of ending things ever crosses your mind, shove it out of your head.”
She never thought she’d feel turned on from being dominated like this. But knowing that this dangerously strong man earnestly wanted her gave her an electrifying thrill. Judging from her reaction to this twisted situation, EunHa’s personality wasn’t that much better either.
“Then fuck me harder. All this tickling is going to kill me.”

EunHa gasped out between pants. KyungHyun grinned and grabbed the back of her head.
EunHa’s face lowered onto his. Their tongues tangled as EunHa continued to squeeze his cock. When her climax overcame her, KyungHyun pulled her tightly against his chest. It was as if he was telling her that he would never let her go ever again.



“Are you trying to punish me with sex?”

EunHa’s limp body was stretched out on top of KyungHyun’s. His large hand was clenching her bottom.
“It feels good, so don’t pull it out.”

Basking in the aftereffects of sex, KyungHyun’s face looked relaxed and comfortable. The hotel room was a mess with the traces of their sex spread throughout the room. Half of the bedsheets were pulled off, and the blanket had already flown away somewhere. Their clothes were haphazardly strewn across the room, and piles of crumpled tissues used to clean their fluids were discarded all over the floor.
“In any case, you’re too much.” “What?”
“If you act like this, every woman will probably run away from you. What will people think when they see this room?”
Even though EunHa said this in jest, KyungHyun considered it seriously. Unable to take a joke, KyungHyun looked at her with a grin. When he felt her cooled skin, he grabbed the sheets and covered her body.
“Aren’t you cold?”

“I’m not cold. I’m hot. You’re too warm.” “Your body is hot on the inside as well.”
KyungHyun began to massage her bottom. There was no way EunHa didn’t realize the desire in his touch. His stiff lower half began to react. EunHa pulled back her hips and began to rub herself against his cock.



“And the only person who can withstand that heat is me.”

EunHa glanced at him as she felt his penis harden underneath her. In the next moment, KyungHyun’s cock was hovering right below her entrance. In some ways, he might be right. He was a man who wouldn’t wither away from her heat. That might be why she was so drawn to him.
“If something happens to my body, you will have to take responsibility.”
“That sounds lovely.”

KyungHyun spread her apart with a grin as he flashed her his white teeth. EunHa closed her eyes as she pulled his hot body into her embrace.
She felt more comfortable being with him than being away from him. Rather than worrying about things that hadn’t happened, she decided to enjoy the time she spent with this man instead.




A man in uniform always stands out. His perfectly fitted uniform had a line of stars embroidered on his shoulders. Instead of coming off as tacky, it actually enhanced his image. He looked like he’d just stepped out of a movie screen. Almost half of his face was covered by his cap, but it didn’t hide his sharp jaw and his stubborn lips. It merely served to add to his arrogant image.
Today, KyungHyun was receiving a commendation for his contribution to the massive eradication of two major gangs. His 12 years of undercover work was finally going to be acknowledged. Seeing him wear his uniform seemed to make it official. He was truly a policeman.
“Wow, isn’t that man freaking handsome?”

Dressed up in a white, skintight outfit, EunHa whispered to the middle-aged person sitting next to her. The man looked at her with a blank expression on his face. He seemed a bit confused and wondered why this strange woman was talking to him.
“I’m not sure. Is what how young women see him?” “Ey, you’re just jealous because you’re a man.”
EunHa boldly looked at the man as she replied. The man looked flustered as he chuckled awkwardly. EunHa’s eyes sparkled as she watched KyungHyun walk down from the podium. In the past, she couldn’t imagine him in a uniform and thought it would look strange on him, but oh my goodness! He looked so handsome that she wanted to race across the room and hug him right away.
“Aren’t you curious about the kind of woman who will end



up with a man like him?”

EunHa slyly whispered. The old man stared at her and asked.

“Are you that punk’s lover?”

“Omo. Ahjussi, you have quite a good eye.”

“That punk hasn’t been able to take his eyes off you this whole time. I doubt he was looking at me.”
What the man said was true. KyungHyun’s eyes were directed at EunHa, who was sitting towards the back of room. She gave him a wink before she turned to the middle-aged man. She whispered to him in a stiff voice.
“You’re correct, but why are you calling him a punk? He’s a precious son of a household, too, you know? My man has a terrible personality, so he won’t go easy on you even if you are his elder. He’s a policeman in name only, you see. His behavior is totally like that of a gangster’s.”
“Then why do you like a punk like that, young lady?”

“He’s too clingy with me. If I begin seeing another man, he’s going to snap his neck. The things some people will do for love… So I decided to tolerate him. It’s just easier that way.”
“Hoho.”

The man chuckled when he saw EunHa smile jokingly. Just then, the commendation ceremony concluded. All the members of the audience rose from their seats as they applauded.
KyungHyun easily recognized EunHa from far away. He wondered why his father was sitting next to her, but that thought promptly flew out of his mind. When he saw her bright smile as she clapped with



the audience, he quickly suppressed the urge to take her to a secluded place so that he could have his way with her.
EunHa followed KyungHyun’s instructions and waited for him at the promised location. Her head whipped from side to side as she looked for him. There was no one inside the movie theater room because the staff was currently preparing for the next screening.
What’s going on?

She tilted her head. In the middle of the empty room, KyungHyun was leaning back in the seat. When he saw her, he got up and called out.
“Over here.”

EunHa let out a sigh of relief and began to make her way over to him.
“What’s going on? Why are we here? You didn’t actually book the whole room, did you?”
She was only joking, but KyungHyun didn’t deny it. “I’ll get in trouble if I walk around in uniform.” “Then you can just change.”
“Who has time for that? I thought I was going to die of embarrassment because someone kept leering at me as I went up to receive my commendation.”
“Why would you feel embarrassed?” “Because of the bulge in my pants.” “Oh god.”
So because of such a ridiculous reason, KyungHyun had gone



ahead and rented out a private VIP room at the movie theater. Was he seriously wasting money over something like that? As if he’d read her mind, KyungHyun laughed languidly.
“We both know we won’t just watch a movie at the movie theater.”
A scoff burst out of EunHa’s lips.

“Come here.”

As soon as she sat down in the couple seat, KyungHyun nose bumped into hers as if he’d been waiting for this moment. Just as his lips were about to lower for a kiss, EunHa pressed it back with her finger. KyungHyun began to place small kisses along her hand.
“Excuse me… Won’t they see us from the projection booth?”
“I’m a policeman. They won’t do anything unnecessary.”

KyungHyun murmured as he handed her a glass of wine. EunHa took a sip. She looked at KyungHyun, who was now completely focused on undoing the buttons of her jacket, and burst out laughing.
“What if you get in more trouble because you are police?” “Then I’ll stop being a policeman, I guess.”
“Then what are you going to do for a living?”

KyungHyun smirked at her.

“I’ve saved away some money as a director of KeumOh. If my superior officers betray me, I’ll have to play my wild card.”
At times like this, EunHa wondered if KyungHyun was actually a bad guy. She looked at him as she shook her head.



“Are you really police?”

“What do I look like in your eyes?” “A con artist lover?”
“I like that.”

KyungHyun replied softly as he smiled at her. He slowly pressed his hot lips onto her exposed shoulder. Seeing KyungHyun in his uniform as his eyes burned with desire, EunHa felt as if she were under a spell. She calmed her throbbing body and turned around.
“Are you the one who picked this movie?” “Yeah, why?”
“It doesn’t suit you.”

“It doesn’t matter. From here on out, you and I are going shoot our own erotic movie.”
KyungHyun murmured as he lowered his disheveled face to lick her chest. EunHa gazed at this man who made her heart race and chuckled softly. Dramatic music filled the room as the screen brightened in front of them. The beginning credits of the movie began to roll.
Doppio senso: a word with a double meaning; a word with a hidden (dark) meaning.






EunHa had been glaring out the window for 30 minutes now. The rain trickled down the windowpane. YongJoon poked her back from behind.
“Hey, what are you doing? You’ve been out of it for a while now.”
“Don’t bother me. Noona isn’t in a very good mood right now.”
“What, are you on your period or something?”

“It’s been a while, hasn’t it? Do you want to see some blood?”
EunHa fiercely glared at him, making YongJoon shut his mouth.

After SungHo disappeared, Serim had collapsed at a frighteningly fast rate. The mighty YongSung, which had had a strong hold on the economy thanks to KeumOh, was no exception. 1 year ago, all the leaders of YongSung were taken into custody. All that was left were the minor illegal companies that were involved in fraud and embezzlement. As these companies started to resurface, the police were busy putting them away one by one.
In the midst of all this, YongJoon quickly wiped his hand clean of criminal organizations and set up a detective agency. But then EunHa, who had worked with him at Serim, popped out of nowhere, set up her desk, and took her place at the agency even though he never asked her to. Back then, she had gone undercover and



infiltrated the enemy organization YongSung in order to spy on a man. However, she hadn’t known that he was actually an undercover cop and ended up sleeping with him. In the end, she fell in love with him as well.
But Lee EunHa came with her own strengths. Despite her nasty personality, EunHa had a knack with customers. She had the ability to extract their souls.
They weren’t only involved with finding missing people or tailing targets. Their services also included finding con artists and conning them back. After EunHa had joined the agency, she brought in enough customers to increase their revenue. They now made a hefty amount of money. It was largely thanks to her that they were even able to move into a bigger office, but…
“Don’t just sit there. Go out and buy some strawberries. Our client will be here soon, and we need offer them some snacks.”
Now matter how one looked at it, he was the president of the company. But as time went on, he felt as if their roles were reversing. Was he only imagining it?
“Hey, where can I find something like that in this season…!”
YongJoon raised his voice indignantly. Where was he supposed to find fruits that were out of season? Just as he raised his voice, the automatic doors burst open.
Welcome to Dragon J Agency. We strive to help you reach your happiness.
“Ah… that surprised me…”

The automatic doors slid open three times faster than your average door. The automatic welcome message blared out at twice



the volume. The surprised woman flinched as she entered the office. Her hand was clenched against her chest. EunHa’s lips stretched into a despicable smile as she burst out of her seat and went to greet the client.
“Welcome. Did you find this place okay?”
“Yes… I left early because of the rain, but it looks like I came here ahead of schedule… I’m sorry.”
The meek woman hesitated to enter as she looked around. She was a client who had come 30 minutes early.
A month ago, this woman had commissioned work from them, but this was the first time EunHa and YongJoon had seen her face. Depending on the type of work they requested, the clients that came to them often didn’t show their faces.
“The weather is quite bad today, so it must have been difficult for you to come to us. Well, I’m sure you came all the way here in order to seek out our expertise, isn’t that right? I may look like a high schooler, but when it comes to this kind of work, it’s my specialty. I’ll give you a small discount on the retainer fee, so if you just say the word, I can have your husband kneeling before you as he begs…”
The woman’s face paled as she listened to YongJoon’s words.

“Why don’t we have a warm cup of coffee first?”

Like a hyena that had found its prey, EunHa cut YongJoon off as she stepped in front of him. She guided the woman to the sofa.
“…Ah, I’m fine. Please, you don’t have to mind me…”

They could tell with just one look that this woman was completely overcome with worry. EunHa turned her head to YongJoon and glared at him.



“YongJoon-ssi, please bring us a warm cup of sweet coffee and a cup of Earl Grey tea from the cafe on the first ﬂoor. Also, could you bring us a slice of shortcake and a Mont Blanc each?”
“Hey, our client just said she didn’t want anything, so why…”
YongJoon recalled the cafe on the first floor and how it always had a long line of customers. He expressed his obvious reluctance to go, but EunHa’s brow furrowed as she glared daggers at him. Her lips were still smiling, but her eyes were giving off a fierce energy, almost like a cat that had drawn its claws.
“And please buy some strawberries on your way back.”

Was she being possessed by a ghost that died because it didn’t eat enough strawberries?
YongJoon suppressed the curse that threatened to burst out of his mouth and left the office. After checking to see that the automatic doors had closed, EunHa softly smiled at the woman who nervously clasped her hands on her lap.
“Many women like talking to other women quietly without the presence of men.”
The woman’s eyes filled with tears as she gazed at EunHa. The elegant woman looked like a flower that had been raised carefully in a greenhouse. She took out a handkerchief from her expensive purse and pressed it along the edge of her eyes. Her trembling lips barely managed to open as she finally revealed the reason for her visit.
“So you’re saying that your husband requested to go on a trip with you, is that right?”
After carefully listening to the woman’s story, EunHa spoke up. The woman slowly nodded her head. Her husband said they should go



and enjoy the changing leaves before the weather became any colder. The last time the couple had gone on a trip together was 1 year ago for their honeymoon.
“So you’re saying you decided you will no longer commission work from us.”
“…I’ll give you the total retainer fee as stated in our contract. I’ll also wire you the remaining half of the expenses.”
EunHa thought about YongJoon’s computer hard drive that was currently filled with photos related to the woman’s husband’s affair. She silently swallowed back a sigh. EunHa’s arms were crossed, and her finger began to tap against her waist. She silently glanced at the woman in front of her.
“……”

It wasn’t as if this customer hadn’t seen these photos. This timid woman clenched her handkerchief as she trembled. Even though she seemed so weak, this woman had still commissioned EunHa to dig into this matter, so she must have had a strong conviction from the start. Seeing the photos were merely the final step in this process. In order to help her cut off any lingering attachment she felt for her husband, EunHa had even sent her some of the more intense photos without any warning.
“Thank you for all your hard work until now.”

The woman lowered her head. EunHa gazed at her as she opened her pursed lips.
“I’ll cut the retainer fee in half, so…” “……”
“Don’t go on the trip. It’s suspicious.”



The woman’s wet eyelashes fluttered when she heard these unexpected words. Her reddened eyes welled up with tears once again. EunHa had quit smoking, but she craved a cigarette right now. She did her best to keep her voice calm as she continued.
“The things we gathered for you… I’m sure you’ve seen them all.”
“…Yes.”
“Don’t you hate your husband? Aren’t you disappointed?” “I am… Very much so. I hate him, and I feel pathetic. But I
also feel guilty.”

EunHa’s brows furrowed. Holding back an inappropriate exclamation, EunHa bit the inside of her cheek.
“My broken heart hasn’t fully recovered, but… No, I’m not even sure if it can recover at this point.”
Watching the woman try to hold herself together made EunHa feel very uncomfortable.
“But I want to try trusting my husband one last time.”

If there was a situation that EunHa absolutely hated running into in this line of work, it was this one right here. She wasn’t very good at comforting others.
“…Don’t you think you may end up regretting it?”

From the evidence that YongJoon had worked very hard to gather, this woman’s husband was an redeemable piece of trash. This woman almost didn’t even have to send someone out to investigate her husband to find out that he was having an affair. This man just swung his dick around everywhere he went. It was obvious that this man approached this naive woman because of her wealth and assets.



“That man understands me even though I’m lacking so much. He’s the only person who accepted me for who I am.”
There was no perfect person in this world. Everyone had flaws, and expecting someone to fill those gaps was foolish. Indulging your partner wouldn’t change anything, and not every human being treated others sincerely. EunHa pushed all these words down the back of her throat and let out a deep sigh.
“So… I want to try and understand that person. If I don’t, I think I’ll regret it.”
The woman swallowed back her tears and looked at EunHa. EunHa suddenly realized something as she looked into the woman’s trembling eyes.
Ah, so it’s like that.

Wanting to give her husband another chance was just an excuse. The woman still loved her husband. The woman was the one who was reluctant to let go. No matter how much people told her to burn the trash, it wouldn’t make a difference.
EunHa instantly felt frustrated. In the past, listening to this kind of story would have annoyed her. Honestly, she did feel a bit annoyed. However, now she also understood this woman’s heart. She felt as if her hormones were all over the place. Was it just her imagination?
“…It looks like you’ve made up your mind. I understand. I wish you luck.”
EunHa tried to keep her tone professional and gave the woman a robotic smile. At that moment, YongJoon grinned as he entered the office with coffee cups in both hands and a small basket of fruit. EunHa immediately got up from her seat and took the cups from his hands.
“Our client is ending the contract starting today.”



“Ah, really? Did she end up deciding to divorce that cheating bast… Aagh!”
Before he could finish those useless words, EunHa dug her finger into his side to shut him up. The client’s face darkened, so EunHa told YongJoon on her behalf that she had reconciled with her husband. YongJoon let out an ‘ah’ and changed his tone.
“Ha… Haha, I see. Well, isn’t that obvious? Our client here has the better body, face, and personality. I couldn’t understand why that husband decided to go out and have affairs with those ugly bitches. Well, isn’t that how it goes sometimes? There are days when the rainy wind blows, and I’m sure there are days when the warm sun rises in the sky. My own grandfather in the countryside was a downright piece of trash who slept around with women. But now that all his teeth fell out, he only follows my gran around wherever she goes. My gran actually hates it and always tells him to go away. Anyways, congratulations. I’m happy to hear that your husband finally returned to his senses. If there’s anything else you need, don’t hesitate to call us…”
The client looked like she was on the verge of tears as she listened to YongJoon’s fiery speech.
“Then I’ll just wire the remaining amount to you.”

The woman looked flustered as she got up from her seat. YongJoon held out the cup of coffee to her.
“Here, why don’t you take this cup of coffee as a sign of our sincerity?”
The woman bit her lip before she finally received the cup of coffee and bowed.
“Thank you.”



“There’s no need to thank me. It’s only a cup of coffee.”

Compared to the retainer fee, this was nothing. YongJoon swallowed these words as his lips stretched into a grin.
“It wasn’t a happy experience for you, but just think of it as a life experience. Just strengthen your heart and face this rough world as you live your life. And don’t trust people too easily.”
Tears began to trickle down from her eyes as she gazed at him. YongJoon blinked. Was she that moved by a cup of coffee? His face turned red with shock. He didn’t know how to handle a crying woman. As always, YongJoon was weak to a woman’s tears. He became restless in the face of this tender woman’s crying eyes.
“If you walk around in the streets crying like that, those con artists are going to target you. Especially since you’re so kind. Wherever you go, ﬂies are going to swarm after you…”
“I’m sorry.”

“No, there’s no need to be sorry.”

“Thank you for all your hard work until now.”

She whispered so quietly that they could barely hear her. The woman grabbed her purse and quickly left the office.
“Wh-What the hell was that? Is she an idiot?”

As soon as the doors closed, YongJoon frowned as he scratched his half-shaven head.
“What a waste of a pretty face.”

The top three buttons on YongJoon’s shirt was unbuttoned, but he didn’t seem cold at all. The exposed part of his chest was flushed all



the way up to his neck.

“So she’s going to try again with that bastard? At her age, I wouldn’t call her naive. She’s just plain stupid. It’s a miracle that she’s managed to survive in this dangerous world with a personality like that.”
EunHa wrapped her hands around the cup of hot tea. Her mood changed so quickly these days. She didn’t even look at the snacks YongJoon had worked very hard to buy. She murmured in a low voice.
“That’s what happens when you’re blinded by love.” “Very funny.”
YongJoon snorted. EunHa leaned back in her chair and stretched her legs out onto the windowsill. She began to shake her feet.
“Well, I guess you wouldn’t know about love anyways.” “Hey, ever since I lost my virginity at the age of fourteen,
I’ve fucked so many women that if we were to line them up,
they’d fill this whole room. If they asked me to write a book about it, I could.”
YongJoon flexed his chest and puffed it out. EunHa opened her mouth and began to speak in a steady voice as if she were teaching an elementary school kid.
“Sex and love don’t always go together, you idiot. You can still have sex without love, and if you love someone, you’ll definitely want to have sex. But it doesn’t mean you love someone because you’re having sex with them.”
“Fuck, what bullshit is that?!”

YongJoon listened to her words with a frown and roared out his reply. EunHa looked at him before shaking her head from side to



side. Then she glanced at him.

“When you’re a little older, you’ll know what this noona is talking about.”
Angered by the way she kept treating him like an idiot, YongJoon began to curse at her. However, EunHa looked away with a strange expression on her face as she chewed on the lip of her to-go cup.
She looked out into the rainy street before letting out a sigh. She turned around in her chair.
“Seo YongJoon.” “What?”
“Give me the report on the husband and his whereabouts from the past week, no, the past month.”
YongJoon, who had been looking for a cigarette, opened his desk drawer and pulled out a hefty bundle of documents. He handed it to her.
“Here. He’s rented out all the villas in the suburbs of Seoul at one point that he even went as far as to go to and look at secluded villas in the countryside with his mistress. I spent so much money on gas just following him around.”
Looking through the documents, one thing in particular caught EunHa’s eye. An empty villa in the mountains. The name of the mountain sounded familiar. She searched through her memories and realized that it came up when Lieutenant Han suggested they go camping there instead of having a housewarming party. Additionally, the date coincided with the one given by the client for her trip with her husband.
“……”



What did this coincidence mean? Was the universe telling her to resolve this uncomfortable suspicion? She couldn’t stop herself from feeling this way.
“YongPal.”

EunHa called YongJoon in a low voice as she continued to go through the documents. After she had quit smoking, she told YongJoon that he wasn’t allowed to smoke in front of her anymore. Therefore, YongJoon was on his way out to have a smoke when EunHa called his name. Holding the unlit cigarette between his lips, YongJoon stopped in his tracks.
“Ah, why do you keep calling me?”

“How much did she pay us for the retainer fee?” “100 million.”
YongJoon’s annoyed expression melted away at the talk of money. He grinned as he slipped the cigarette behind his ear and began to speak excitedly.
“Do you know how nervous I was? I thought she’d tell us she’d just pay for the expenses alone. But as soon as she left, we got the deposit. I wonder how much that con artist of a husband makes. Fucking bastard. I bet his dick is fucking tiny…”
YongJoon continued to ramble on. EunHa’s cat-like eyes widened.
That’s right. Nothing was free in this world.

“If she paid us 100 million, we need to make sure it’s worth it.”
“…Huh?”

YongJoon had a feeling that things were going to get complicated.



He stopped talking and slowly began to walk out of the room. Since they had already gotten the money, he could just play and eat as much as he wanted for a few months. But because of that crazy gleam in EunHa’s eyes, something didn’t feel right.
“You need to do some work.”

“What? We’ve already received the money, so what more needs to be done? Leave it alone. We’re done talking. I’m not doing it!”
YongJoon fiercely glared at EunHa, but EunHa’s eyes fired back with a glare of her own.
“Your face looks like dog shit, but your personality sure doesn’t make up for it.”
“Hey, when I go to the hostess bars, I’m fucking popular, alright? All the girls beg to see my junk.”
EunHa clenched her teeth and pretended she didn’t hear what he just said. She didn’t even bat an eye as she continued talking.
“So what if you have a big dick? Don’t you have a conscience?”
“Why are you talking about my conscience all of a sudden?”
“You need to put in the work if you’ve received the money. This whole situation looks strange. That man has been having a fiery affair with his mistress all this time. You even got pictures of them fearlessly shaking the car in the apartment parking lot as they went at it yesterday! So why does he suddenly want to go on a trip with his wife? The answer is obvious, so are you just pretending not to know or are you seriously that stupid?”



EunHa’s voice grew louder as she spoke. She finished her thoughts by slamming her hand on her desk.
“If this is how you’re going to do your work, get out!”

Pressed down by her spirit, YongJoon flinched. Suddenly, he returned to his senses and shouted back.
“Hey! This is my company!” “Ah, that’s right.”
EunHa suddenly grew quiet. EunHa shrugged and reached for her purse. Just a moment ago, she was frowning and shouting at him. All of a sudden, she was acting like nothing happened. YongJoon thought she was seriously insane.
“Then I guess I’ll quit.”

YongJoon’s face paled and turned red repeatedly. Considering the monthly rental cost of this office, YongJoon couldn’t afford to lose EunHa like this. He didn’t want to admit it, but she was quite talented. And thanks to her, he was getting quite a big chunk of change from his secret part-time job.
“Hey, wait!”

“What is it, Mr. President? Are you going to give me severance pay?”
YongJoon grabbed the entire pack of cigarettes from his pocket and got up from his seat. He walked over to EunHa and began to tap it as he spoke in a coaxing tone.
“Why are you so quick tempered? I was going to think about it after having a smoke! Because you made such a big deal about the smell, I can’t smoke it in the office. And I can’t even think straight because I have a headache from the lack



of nicotine.”

“Smoking is prohibited inside this entire building, you idiot.”
It was laughable coming from her. She wasn’t exactly the most law-abiding young woman. YongJoon narrowed his eyes in disbelief.
“Where is this burning sense of justice coming from all of a sudden? It doesn’t suit you.”
“Do you really not know?”

EunHa blinked her innocent eyes at him. YongJoon frowned as he pulled his head back.
“…What are you doing?”

“My man is a policeman who received a commendation from the president. As a policeman’s lover, shouldn’t I spread this law-abiding spirit onto others?”
“…Are you joking?”

“Typical. Of course you’d think it’s a joke. I don’t know why I expected more from a man who doesn’t have a girlfriend and doesn’t know what love really is.”
EunHa bragged about her lover without batting an eye. Thanks to her, Shin KyungHyun’s unpleasant face popped into YongJoon’s head. He looked up at the ceiling and let out a miserable sigh. Thanks to that amazing lover of hers, he couldn’t even do as he pleased. YongJoon felt as if his insides were boiling in hellfire. If something happened to EunHa, he’d disappear before anyone could put him in jail. Just like his previous boss SungHo.
“Do you know why I’m letting you stay by my woman’s side? Think very hard about the reason why I let you escape a



10 year prison sentence when you could have just rotted there instead. If you do anything stupid, I’ll kill you.”
“Then can’t you can just watch over her yourself, 24/7?” “My girl doesn’t like that.”
Click. KyungHyun lit his cigarette and kept it between his lips. As he muttered these words to YongJoon, KyungHyun’s eyes gleamed. It was as if he could kill with just a look. As he threatened YongJoon, he looked just like a gangster. Just remembering this made a chill run down YongJoon’s spine.
“Hey, are you a prince or something?” “Do you really wanna die?”
“I complimented you, so why are you acting like this?”

Endure it. Enduring is winning. YongJoon suppressed the boiling anger as he glared at her. EunHa opened the basket of fruit as she continued.
“If you’re going to go, hurry up. You have a lot to do when you get back.”
“Ah, I’m seriously going to…”

YongJoon shoved his hat on and began to head outside. They hadn’t even gotten a chance to torture that cheating husband. Just remembering how that trembling woman nervously clasped her hands on her lap piqued YongJoon’s anger. Whether it was this woman or that woman, they were all the same. They were all annoying.
As if the rain shower from two days ago had cleared the skies of dust, the weather was extremely clear today. The clouds looked like unraveled threads as they stretched across the deep blue sky. They



wrapped around the mountain ridges like a painting.

“I’m going to enter the highway here.”

“It’s better if you take the interchange. There’s construction at a tunnel nearby.” 
“Yes, sir.”

General Manager Cha responded as his hands gripped the steering wheel. Lietenant Han, who was sitting next to General Manager Cha, spoke up with barely suppressed anger.
“If you were going to be like this, why didn’t you drive instead?”
Ever since KyungHyun had gotten into the car, he was full of commands. Stop at that rest stop, turn down the AC, turn off this loud music and put on some classical music instead, and so on and so on.
“If I drive, I can’t kiss EunHa. And I’m a deputy commissioner now. You’re the superintendent.” 
“If you know that, why don’t you change the way you address us, sunbae-nim?”
Even though it had been a while since they finished their undercover investigation and gotten promotions, KyungHyun continued to call them ‘General Manager Cha’ and ‘Lieutenant Han’.
“It’s good for a superior officer to do whatever he wants.
That way, your juniors can enjoy talking behind your back.”

“We’re not people who have the free time to gather together and talk about our superior officers behind their backs.”



“Then do it starting now.”

KyungHyun answered languidly as he leaned to one side in the backseat. EunHa could tell just by looking at the back of Lieutenant Han’s head that she was furious. She felt slightly apologetic. When she felt KyungHyun’s hand slide around her waist, she gave it a sharp pinch.
“Control yourself.” “It hurts.”
It would have been less annoying if his facial expression matched his words, but KyungHyun’s cold face had a faint smile, and he didn’t even move his hand away. EunHa looked at him and tried to suppress her anger.
And for some reason, he was in an incredibly good mood today. He kept laughing and whispering into her ear about how he was going crazy from wanting to have sex with her this instant. Thanks to that, this spacious RV felt suffocating.
“I’m only saying this since we’re not at work, but I’m not driving right now because I don’t want to kiss SungYeon.”
“Are you crazy?”

Lieutenant Han paled in shock as she looked at General Manager Cha, who had blurted out these words. Kyunghyun, whose head was bent over EunHa’s neck for a kiss, glanced over at the front of the RV through a mirror. He began to chuckle.
“Endure it.”

“As a man who has a hard time doing so yourself, you know very well that it isn’t easy.”
“Hey, Cha JoongWon.”



This was a new, private side of the Lieutenant Han couple that EunHa had never seen before. Whenever they were working, General Manager Cha looked like a live robot. But right now, he was looking at Lieutenant Han as if he were a teenage boy.
At their wedding, General Manager Cha had vigorously brought Lieutenant Han into his arms and bent her backwards as he gave her a kiss. Recalling this scene, EunHa laughed softly. It turned out that these two were childhood friends living in the same neighborhood who developed into a young couple. Hearing their history together was quite entertaining.
“Are you guys doing this in front of me to show me you’re a married couple now? Have your couple fights in bed.”
“Superintendent Shin, what are you saying…”

Lieutenant Han’s serious words went in one ear and out the other as KyungHyun wrapped his large hand around EunHa’s cheek. He turned her face so that she was looking at him. He stared at her with narrowed eyes. As he slowly blinked, his gaze turned sensual. His languid voice flowed out of his throat.
“I wish it would rain.”
“…We’re all going camping, so why would you say something like that?”
“I have no interest in camping.”

He didn’t have to tell her twice. KyungHyun’s outfit wasn’t suitable for camping at all. He was wearing a black turtleneck with a long brown coat that went down along his legs. One could say he was wearing a clean, basic outfit, but on him it looked eye-catching. EunHa wasn’t the only one who felt this way. Whenever they stopped at a rest stop, he caught people’s attention.
“Then why did you come?”



“I was following you.”

He whispered so that only she could hear.

“I’ve always wanted to have sex in a forest.” “Just… why?”
“It sounds like it’ll feel primitive.” “Pervert.”
“I know.”

KyungHyun’s face looked like that of a model from a magazine pictorial. EunHa was at a loss for words as she heard these words leave his mouth. EunHa clenched her jaw and banged her head against the headrest. KyungHyun watched lovingly as she closed her eyes so that she wouldn’t have to see him. He wrapped his hand around her head. After pulling her head in the space between his neck and shoulder, KyungHyun pressed his lips against the crown of her head and murmured in a low voice.
“Yeah, get some sleep now. If we’re going to get you pregnant tonight, it’s going to be a long night.”
“If you say one more word, I’m going to jump out of this car.”
EunHa’s voice hissed out of her clenched teeth. KyungHyun silently swallowed a laugh. He knew very well that she was a woman who was capable of doing something like that. It always kept him on his toes. She was like a rubber ball. He never knew which direction she’d bounce, and he was afraid he’d lose her if he didn’t keep a tight hold on her.
“Stay still.”



“It’s so uncomfortable.”

KyungHyun’s arms tightened on her as she squirmed. She muttered against his chest before ultimately giving up and falling asleep. The weak sunlight pierced through the tinted windows and tickled her face. Her brows furrowed. KyungHyun raised his large hand and blocked the sunlight. He wanted to pour kisses down on her face, but he felt that EunHa would really jump out of the car if he did.
“Should we just go back on our own? That’s what those two probably want.”
Lieutenant Han overheard this and rejoiced in her heart. However, EunHa slapped KyungHyun’s large thigh.
“Seriously, be quiet.”

KyungHyun grumpily grabbed her hand and pulled it under his coat. Her hand flinched as it touched a hard bulge. Then she began to caress it softly as if to console him. KyungHyun slightly wrinkled his nose as he savored the sensation.
This was a man who made a little bit of time during his workday to find her and take her clothes off whenever he wanted to have sex. If it weren’t for General Manager Cha and Lieutenant Han being in the same car, KyungHyun would have given her a deep kiss and then some, even if she did her best to push him away.
“I’m sorry for this uncooperative companion. I apologize on his behalf.”
“It’s not your fault, EunHa-ssi. Superintendent Shin, I mean, Deputy Commissioner Shin is the one who hates doing these kinds of things outside of work… But we’re the ones who made the mistake of not expecting him to take up our offer to join us.”
Lieutenant Han let out a sigh. KyungHyun’s face gradually



hardened as he listened to her. Knowing the reason behind this reaction, EunHa cold-heartedly stopped her hand. KyungHyun chewed on his lip as he slowly let out a deep breath.
He was seriously going crazy.

Lieutenant Han had a good head on her shoulders. After having her wedding, she told all her colleagues, who were asking about a housewarming party, that instead of throwing one, they’d go camping instead. As expected, everyone seemed reluctant to go and declined her offer. The couple told everyone to come with their own food, but they were basically telling everyone not to come. It was also impossible for the whole violent crimes department to take a 2- day-1-night vacation at the same time.
Of course, even if KyungHyun had the time, he didn’t plan on going. He was busy spending all his valuable time embracing his woman, who was never easy to catch. He also didn’t feel like watching Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha display their love in front of him.
Two days ago, after a long, hot round of sex, they were lying in bed when EunHa suddenly announced that she wanted to go camping with them.
“Are you tired of spending time with me, just the two of us? Are you bored? Or is it because you’ve had a change of heart and want to play hide-and-seek again?”
Even though they had been living together for over 6 months now, KyungHyun was still worried that that she would suddenly disappear one day. If it weren’t for the reports he received from the mole he had planted in her agency, he felt like he would have gone crazy a long time ago.
“Excuse me. You need to make some time and go to the hospital.”



KyungHyun watched her squirm as she turned her back to him. He brought her into a tight embrace. He split her knees open with his thigh. Her entrance was still wet with his semen from their last session. He ground himself against her as he penetrated her once again. He whispered the words he had kept locked up in his heart.
“EunHa, do you want to get pregnant?” “…What did you say?”
As expected, EunHa flinched and tried to hide her shock. KyungHyun drew his hips back and grabbed her as she struggled to escape from his embrace. He locked her within his arms.
Like a little child, KyungHyun began to roughly caressed her chest and pinched her nipples. He continued to rub her until the clitoris hidden underneath her folds was completely swollen. His cock began to grow wet with her warm juices.
“Get pregnant, EunHa. Just get pregnant.”

Grumbling about how she already had enough on her plate, EunHa told him to stop saying such unpleasant things and tried to push him away. However, he didn’t stop pumping his hips until EunHa’s body flushed with desire and a climax rolled through her.
As her shrill cry rang in the room, her walls stuck to him as he continued to ram in and out of her entrance, milking him. KyungHyun ejaculated inside her a few times. As if he wanted to fill her up with every drop of his seed, he took his finger and pushed the few drops of semen that had flowed out of her entrance back inside her.
“…Do you hate the thought of getting pregnant with my child that much?” “I hate it.” “Why?” “Isn’t it obvious? I’d rather relive what happened China.” “Tell me this obvious reason of yours.”
After their intense bout of sex was over, KyungHyun laid her limp



body down on top of his as he asked with a blank expression. EunHa’s cheek was resting on his left chest, so she could feel the vibration of his racing heart. EunHa chewed her lips and murmured back.
“…If I have a kid, I’ll only suffer. My life until now has been hard enough, so I don’t want to suffer any more hardships.”
KyungHyun’s fingers grazed down her back before clenching her bottom. She could feel his desire through his touch.
“Do you think I’ll let you suffer? Are you worried I’ll leave you to be a single parent?”
KyungHyun was also about to ask her if she thought of him as an asshole who’d do something like that when EunHa shook her head.
“That’s not what I mean.” “Then explain it so that I can understand.”
EunHa hesitated. She looked as if she had a lot to say but didn’t know where to begin. She let out a deep sigh before speaking in a grave voice.
“You and I… We haven’t lived normal lives.” “…So?” “I’m worried that we won’t be able to live normal lives in the future.”
EunHa was speaking about the responsibilities that came with having a child. Every time she recalled how her own mother had worried for her safety until the moment she died, EunHa’s heart filled with dread. There was a chance her child would be put in harm’s way because of her. It made her even more nervous. KyungHyun couldn’t understand her worries.
“There’s no need to wear yourself out over useless worries.
As long as you’re by my side, everything will be fine.”



EunHa looked at him as he gave her his typical, arrogant words.
EunHa let out another tired sigh.

“Then do you want me to get pregnant?” “Isn’t it obvious?”

“I’d like to hear that obvious reason as well. Why would you like me to get pregnant? Do you love children? Do you want children?”
Instead of answering, KyungHyun’s hand gripped her bottom a little harder. EunHa lifted her head. As her body rubbed against his lower half, she felt him harden again.
“That’s not the case. If I get pregnant, you’re going to use that as an excuse to keep me locked up. If I’m wrong, say so.” “…Will that excuse work? Then shouldn’t we have at least five children?” “Have you lost your mind?”
Instead of going along with his joke, EunHa shouted in shock. She looked so cute. Like an angry cat, her eyes gleamed. He would even willingly give her his hand if she wanted to scratch him.
“This is why it won’t work with you. I seriously hate it to death.”
EunHa pounded her fist against his chest. KyungHyun brought the reluctant EunHa into his embrace as he imagined her sleeping with their wriggling children. His lips couldn’t help but stretch into a smile.
“Ah, it looks like we’re almost there.”

EunHa had been leaning on KyungHyun when her eyes brightened as she looked out the window. EunHa had always told him she was never interested in taking trips, so why did she suddenly want to go camping? KyungHyun pondered this as he slowly pressed his lips against her ear. Whatever it was, it didn’t matter. Even if she planned on running away right now, he felt like he could give her a three-day head start. He was in a great mood today.



TN: I think you know where this is headed, but keep your expectations low, people!
Also, poor YongJoon… He was bossed around by SungHo, and now he’s being bossed around by EH… in his own company, LOL. I love how YongJoon named his company the ‘Dragon J Agency’ after his name. Yong = Dragon; Joon = J (just like how G-Dragon comes from Ji-Yong)






The campsite was completely empty, and they were the only ones there. EunHa recalled how General Manager Cha had said it was hard to make a reservation here even on weekdays because of the splendid colors of the autumn leaves. She tilted her head.
“It doesn’t seem like this place is packed.”

KyungHyun spoke up as if he had read EunHa’s mind. General Manager Cha was on his way back from receiving the materials required for starting a fire from the campsite owner. Even he had a bewildered expression on his face.
“It seems that a company had reserved this site for their office outing for 2 days and 1 night, but they canceled last minute. But you don’t even like loud places, so I think this turned out for the better.”
Camping maniacs Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha took out their camping gear and quickly set up their tent. They were letting KyungHyun and EunHa use the bed in the RV, so only one tent was needed. They set up the necessary equipment for their barbecue on top of a simple table. After preparing all the ingredients, everyone gathered around the table and sat down. The sky had darkened around them.
“What are you doing? Why aren’t you eating?”

EunHa readily popped the piece of meat dangling from KyungHyun’s chopsticks and deliciously gulped it down. When Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha saw this scene, they turned away from KyungHyun with an unpleasant expression on their faces.



“I am eating.”

KyungHyun held up another piece of meat with his chopsticks, and EunHa popped it into her mouth. She happily chewed on the juicy morsel. Maybe it was because he had fed her ever since she was trapped inside the YongSung hotel, but EunHa never felt uncomfortable being fed by KyungHyun.
“This is Korean beef, so you can eat as much as you want.
Your face looks thin.”

“I got it, so give it to me slowly.” “Okay.”
KyungHyun wiped her mouth with his thumb before putting it into his own mouth. Watching the PDA in front of them, General Manager Cha did his best to maintain a blank face. However, Lieutenant Han began to shiver as if she couldn’t take it anymore.
“SungYeon, put on a jacket if it’s too cold.” “I’m not cold, I’m just getting goosebumps…”
Despite her protests, General Manager Cha took off his own jacket and draped it over her shoulders. EunHa grinned as she watched the newly wedded couple.
“It doesn’t look like you drink a lot of liquor, EunHa-ssi.” “It’s because I’m in a good mood without having to drink
any liquor. It’s been a while since I was able to come out like
this and enjoy the fresh air. Anyways, I noticed that Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha were pretty good at setting up that tent earlier. You guys seem like pros.”
“SungYeon and I have gone on trips together ever since we were young, so we’re pretty used to it.”



General Manager Cha’s eyes were filled with warmth as he looked at Lieutenant Han. EunHa let out a soft exclamation as she stared them in awe.
“Wow.” “What is it?”
“You both seem so different than when you’re at work. General Manager Cha, how were you able to hold back expressing your love for Lieutenant Han whenever you were both working together?”
“They didn’t hold back.”

KyungHyun, who hadn’t had much to say until now, raised his glass of wine as he answered EunHa’s question.
“What?”

“I’ve caught these two kissing many times.”

“That’s because Superintendent Shin is always popping up out of nowhere…”
General Manager Cha slid his glasses up his nose even though it wasn’t slipping down.
“So I always told you to continue with whatever you were doing and left you guys alone. Thanks to me, you guys were able to fuck as much as you wanted in the office of the KeumOh building.”
“Sunbae-nim, how can you say something like that in front of EunHa-ssi?”
“I don’t mind it at all, though.”

EunHa grinned. Actually, it made them seem more human to her.



KyungHyun clasped her hand and grinned as well.

“My girl says she doesn’t mind.”

“Yes, all right. You both suit each other very well.” “We know.”
Lieutenant Han looked exasperated. She declared that she didn’t know what EunHa saw in KyungHyun to stay with such a rigid man like him as she shook her head.
EunHa replied that she knew he was arrogant, but that his handsome looks made up for it a lot. No one laughed at EunHa’s blunt words. However, KyungHyun wrapped his hand around her face and chuckled softly.
“I guess I should thank my parents.” “You really need to.”
EunHa fervently agreed as she nodded her head. When he saw her reaction, KyungHyun’s soft chuckle became louder. His large hand softly stroked her head.
“Stop it, that’s enough.” “Okay.”
Despite his words, his hand didn’t stop. Only when EunHa slightly pulled back her head did he reluctantly rub her earlobe instead.
When a refreshing breeze blew by, EunHa raised her head and cooled her flushed face. Thanks to her client, she had unexpectedly found herself coming on this trip. But it was quite a pleasant night. It had been a while since she left Seoul and had some fresh air. She felt her head clear up as she continued to breathe in the clean air.
“EunHa-ssi, Superintendent Shin killed so many people in



China that the higher-ups had a hard time dealing with the repercussions. You heard about that, right? If he had killed Li Kahui in the process, we would have been in big trouble, but thankfully that didn’t happen.”
“Either way, that bastard will be sentenced to death.”

“I heard that the drug cartel has its connections within the Chinese police, so there’s a chance he may come out of this alive.”
“That’s even better.”

Although he had already killed the man who had injected EunHa with that drug, whenever KyungHyun recalled Li Kahui, the one who had ordered it, he felt a fire burn deep inside his chest. Lieutenant Han shook her head as she watched KyungHyun throw back the glass of liquor.
“You beat his face until it wasn’t recognizable, and you’re still not satisfied? I heard the police were sick to their stomachs when they saw the scene. Our boss is this kind of man, EunHa-ssi.”
“The mood was pretty good, so why did you have to break it like this?”
“I’m only letting her know about the kinds of things you’ve done.”
“You’re going to shock EunHa.”

“I don’t think there’s anything that can shock me now. It’s not like I don’t know what your personality is like.”
The night deepened as they talked about the things that happened in China. Even though EunHa was participating in the conversation, she often checked her phone for any new messages.



She had been getting reports from YongJoon as he kept watch, but there were no new messages from him for the past 30 minutes. The last message he had sent her reported that their client was enjoying a friendly glass of wine with her husband.
YongJoon had set up his camera equipment near the villa and was watching over the situation. He grumbled that, at this rate, he was going to watch a live performance of the couple rolling around together. But it seemed that he was still thoroughly doing his job.
“What are you thinking about?”

KyungHyun’s voice pulled her out of her thoughts. EunHa turned her head. His sculpted face was close to hers. His breath smelled like wine. He didn’t seem affected by the liquor, so she hadn’t paid any attention to how much he drank. However, she now saw the empty bottle of wine on the ground.
“Stop drinking wine like it’s water.”

“It’s because I’m in a good mood, so I drank your share as well.”
KyungHyun’s lips stretched into a smile. Actually, this was true. KyungHyun had been in an incredibly good mood for the past few days.
“Superintendent Shin doesn’t get drunk, so don’t worry too much, EunHa-ssi.”
The Lieutenant Han couple seemed familiar with KyungHyun’s drinking ability and didn’t try to stop KyungHyun as he drank the entire bottle of wine. EunHa let out a sigh when KyungHyun suddenly grabbed her hand.
“…What is it?”

“Let’s go on a walk. We should leave these two alone.”



She couldn’t refuse his request. General Manager Cha, who had driven them here, seemed to be falling asleep as he slowly leaned his head against Lieutenant Han’s shoulder. One could tell that they had spent a long time together and that they had complete trust in each other.
EunHa wondered if a time like that would come for her and KyungHyun. She looked up at him, and their eyes met. KyungHyun raised his brows and smiled at her.
“What?”

Even though his juniors had told her that he didn’t get drunk, they only said this because they didn’t really know him that well.
Whenever KyungHyun drank, his long eyes became much more narrow, and his lips would occasionally stretch into a smile like right now. If one didn’t look closely, they wouldn’t be able to tell if he was smiling or grimacing. It made the spectator feel strange and uncomfortable.
“…It’s nothing.”

EunHa hesitated for a moment before shaking her head. She grabbed his hand. Almost as if he had been waiting for it, KyungHyun tightened his hand around hers. EunHa’s pulse began to speed up as she felt his heat encompass her hand.
“Then shall we walk around for a bit?”

They began to head down the small mountain path behind the campsite. General Manager Cha had said that it was a popular hiking trail in the daytime. As expected, the trail was neat and well- maintained. EunHa recalled how General Manager Cha had explained that there was a small observation deck at the top of the mountain trail where they could see the sight of the village below in one look. They slowly began to climb this mountain path in the dark.



“Stay close. There’s a cliff to the side.”

“I have good night vision. I’m used to seeing in the dark.”

Because of SungHo, she had often been locked up in dark places, so EunHa was used to seeing in the dark. As the unpleasant memories began to fill her head, EunHa did her best to swallow the lump in her throat. KyungHyun wrapped his arm around her hip.
“That’s disappointing.” “What is?”
“I thought that if I took you somewhere dark, you’d cling on to me because you were scared.”
“I’m sorry for shattering your expectations.” “It’s okay. I can just pull you to me instead.”
EunHa laughed in disbelief as he stuck her even closer to his body.

“Come here.”

The mountain path was still damp from yesterday’s rain. They could smell the dirt. EunHa slowed down and leaned her head against KyungHyun’s shoulder.
“You know…” “Hm?”
“Walking like this reminds me of the past.” “What do you mean?”
“That time after we ate at the traditional Korean restaurant. The first time I ever went on a walk with you.”



Back then, KyungHyun was someone who could strike fear in someone’s heart with just one glance. And yet she was trying so hard to get close to him. EunHa heard his slightly husky voice speak in a satisfied tone above her head.
“The day I asked you out on our first date?”

“No matter how I look at it, that was just a company dinner.”
“I don’t go out of my way to spend time with a woman I’m not interested in.”
He rubbed his chin against the top of her head as he replied indifferently. How like him. EunHa chuckled softly as she matched his steps. She was a woman who used to live without knowing what tomorrow would bring. Back then, she wouldn’t have ever expected to be walking in the backwoods of a mountain with KyungHyun like this.
“Even though you knew why I approached you and who I actually was, how could you have been drawn to a woman like me?”
EunHa murmured. KyungHyun pressed his lips to her hair.

“That’s why I spent half a month holding back. If I didn’t do that, I would have seduced you on the first day you entered the office.”
“Seduced me? Haha, do you even know how to do something like that?”
That word didn’t seem to suit him at all. Her breaths puffed out into the cold air as she laughed. The cold, mountain breeze felt good against her face.
“Then what do you call that night I went to your 



apartment?” 

So abruptly opening her locked door and chaotically pouring kisses down onto her face was his way of seducing someone…? It was the world’s most disorganized seduction.
“You were definitely drawn to me as well.”

KyungHyun came to this conclusion and didn’t give her a chance to refute. Either way, no matter what she said, he wouldn’t change his attitude about this anyway.
EunHa took in another cold breath and laughed. KyungHyun slowly came to a stop underneath a large tree. Then he grabbed her shoulders and turned her around so that they were looking at each other.
“What is it?”

EunHa pretended not to know what he was doing as KyungHyun looked her square in the eyes.
“You really don’t know?” “Are you going to kiss me?” “Correct.”
EunHa’s hair, which had grown longer, blew in the wind. KyungHyun took his large hand and swept her hair back as he brought his face down to hers. At the smell of his musk, EunHa felt as if her heart had jumped to her throat as it raced.
“And we’re probably going to have sex.” “Tell me you’re joking.”
“I don’t say anything I don’t mean.”



“Then endure it for a little longer.” “…I wish I could.”
The full moon behind his back suited him. The wind ruﬄed his black hair and caused it to fall onto his forehead. He looked so tempting. The moonlight created sharp shadows on his face.
“Any control I have seems to fade away whenever I’m with you.”
KyungHyun pulled her inside his long coat and wrapped it around her as he hugged her. The large tree was at her back, and the person in front of her was a large man who was as sturdy as a tree.
KyungHyun grinned down at EunHa even though he had effectively trapped her. The familiar body heat of the man gradually surrounded her.
It was warm.

EunHa raised her cat-like eyes as she gazed at him. Then she slowly closed them and opened them.
“It’s dangerous if you continue to look at me like that.”

KyungHyun lowered his voice.

“I know. I did it on purpose.”

At EunHa’s reply, KyungHyun let out a soft groan and licked his lips as if he were thirsty. The smile left his face, and EunHa could clearly see the dark desire swirl in his eyes. This man never hid his desire for her when he was with her.
EunHa’s heart began to beat faster. His sharp nose slowly lowered down to hers. The chilly night air contrasted with his feverish heat. KyungHyun kept his eyes locked on hers as he slowly parted his lips.



Then their breaths clashed together in an instant.

His tongue easily parted her lips and entered her mouth. He sucked on her warm tongue, causing a moan to escape her throat.
“Hnng…!”

The large hand that had been caressing the back of her head gripped it tighter. Their lips pressed even harder together. His sharp nose poked against her cheek as they exchanged breaths.
“Haa…”

EunHa gasped for breath. Her wet lips parted, and her tongue flashed behind them. EunHa continued to pant as she gazed at KyungHyun. He stretched out his hand and lowered it down towards her face. His hard chest rose and fell with his own labored breaths. His gruff voice left his mouth.
“…I knew this would happen.”

KyungHyun took off his coat and put it on her. Then he pulled up her sweater and grabbed her breast.
“Haa, w…wait a minute…” “Stay still.”
KyungHyun replied as if by habit. Then he raked his hand through her hair. His other hand had already made its way inside her bra. EunHa’s body trembled from the tingling pleasure. It looked like KyungHyun really wasn’t planning on stopping until he went all the way to the end.
There had never been a time it had ended with just a kiss. For her man, a kiss was just a step leading to sex. KyungHyune softly caressed her breast as if it belonged to him and sucked on the nape of her neck.



“Haaagh…!”
Vrrrr.

A cellphone was vibrating. It surprised EunHa, causing her eyes to open wide. She had completely forgotten about the reason why she came here.
“Wait… hnng… Wait a minute.”

KyungHyun continued to squeeze her breast and left bite marks along her collarbone. It didn’t look like he was going to stop anytime soon. He was like a stone statue that craved her body. EunHa pounded her fist against his shoulder. She barely managed to pull away and quickly reached her hands into her pockets. However, there was nothing inside. She had forgotten her cellphone at the campsite in her haste to get out.
“What was that? It sounded like a phone.”

KyungHyun clicked his tongue and took his phone out from inside his coat pocket. Then he looked down at the screen and let out an angry curse.
“Ah, fuck…”

He answered the call with a frown.

“What is it?”

KyungHyun brought the phone to his ear. He furrowed his brow.
Suddenly, EunHa saw a light flickering far away.

Rustle.

EunHa turned her head at the sound. Although this was a hiking path during the daytime, no one would be walking it at this time of night. No one should have been here other than them.



“Honey, I’m scared. Let’s go back, hm?”

KyungHyun ended his call and began to pull at her arm. EunHa’s face hardened underneath the shadow of the tree. No way.
“What’s there to be scared about? We’re only going on a walk.”
“Then I want to go back by myself. It’s so dark, I can’t see… I can’t see very well.”
The thin voice traveled with the wind. EunHa recognized this voice. When she heard the tearful voice of her client, EunHa’s eyes widened in the dark.
She knew this would happen. She thought it sounded strange from the start. As expected, her client’s husband had brought her client here to carry out his dangerous plan. It was her mistake relaxing when she got YongJoon’s report saying that the couple was enjoying a nice glass of wine together.
“That bastard seriously…”

EunHa clenched her teeth and was about to run over to them when KyungHyun held her back.
“Do you know her?”

EunHa quickly answered him in a low voice.

“She’s my client. Her cheating husband suddenly asked her to go on a trip together. I thought it was strange and decided to follow them here.”
“So that’s why you wanted to come here.”

KyungHyun’s low voice sounded slightly disappointed. Even if he was angry that she hadn’t told him sooner, she would have to explain



it to him later. Right now, it looked like the scene unfolding before her eyes was about to get serious.
“I’ll tell you the details later.” “Wait.”
He held EunHa back just as she was about to run towards the couple. KyungHyun shook his head. EunHa saw that his phone was currently video recording the couple. She frowned.
“If you want to make sure he can’t get away with it, we need to make sure there aren’t any loopholes.”
“If we wait any longer, it’s going to get dangerous.”

KyungHyun was waiting for the right time because he was trying to gather evidence. EunHa knew that.
“Just wait a little longer.”

KyungHyun was always careful and rarely made mistakes. It wouldn’t hurt to listen to him. EunHa had experienced this herself.
But…
“Honey, please…!”

EunHa heard her client as she was dragged away. She nervously chewed on her fingernails. She knew better than anyone what her client was feeling just by hearing the fear in her voice.
“Stop your whining. I’ll send you off well, so don’t worry.” “Aagh!”
As the man grabbed her wrist, the client burst into tears.
“Why are you doing this, honey… Huu!”



“‘Honey’? That’s hilarious. Cry out like that as much as you want once you’re dead.”
“Honey, please don’t do this. Honey!”

The man dragged the woman off the trail and brought her to the edge of the cliff.
“You’ve had me followed. Did you think I wouldn’t notice? Sleepwalking, depression… You have every kind of mental illness known to man. You should have thanked me for marrying a crazy bitch like you. And instead, you had me followed? And you even gave those bastards 100 million? Fuck… Do you know how shitty it feels to have to receive an allowance from you?”
“Huu…”

“If you died from falling off the cliff, I’m sure your family will be secretly happy. They’ll think you did it, and they’ll be happy to be rid of a sniveling crazy bitch who’s always holed up in her room all day. No one will be saddened by your death. I wonder how everyone will feel when they find out that your share of the inheritance has been handed over to me. Hey, you stupid bitch. Do you even know how loud your trusted lawyer can be in bed? It’s not even close to how you lie there like a corpse…”
EunHa couldn’t take it anymore. There was enough evidence, and this piece of trash needed to be punished. She shot out from behind the tree like a bullet and let out a shrill cry.
“Hey! You fucking son of a bitch, shut your mouth!”

The man turned around and his face twisted into a scowl. He grabbed the woman’s arm and began to walk faster.
“Aagh! Let go!”



EunHa quickly moved towards the sound of her screaming client.
Then she grabbed the man’s body.

“Who’s this crazy bitch?!”
“I’m a ghost who came to kill you, you dirty bastard… Agh!”
The man swung his arm and his elbow hit the side of EunHa’s face hard. She shot daggers at him through her disheveled hair.
“…You’re dead, you son of a bitch.”

The man unconsciously flinched as EunHa glared at him. “Has this crazy bitch seriously lost her mind…?” Bang!
The sound of a gunshot rang in the air. EunHa had kicked him in the shin, and the man had grabbed her by the throat. However, his body suddenly shrank at the sound of the piercing gunshot.
The man clearly heard the bullet lodge itself inside the bark of the tree next to him. His shocked eyes began to tremble as a large shadow loomed over his head. He felt someone seize the hair on his head.
“Ugh!”

KyungHyun pulled back his large hand before slamming it down onto the man’s face. The man grabbed his broken nose as he let out a shriek. Red streaks of blood began to flow down his hand.
“Aaaagh!”

“Lift your head.”

KyungHyun hissed through his clenched teeth. EunHa decided to



leave the man to KyungHyun and raced to her client, who was still collapsed on the ground in shock. EunHa helped her up.
“Are you okay?”

Slam!

EunHa herad a loud thud behind her and turned around. The man had completely collapsed onto the ground. The man managed to land a blow on KyungHyun’s head. KyungHyun grabbed the man’s throat and slammed his fist down onto the man’s face once again.
“You fucking son of a bitch…” “Ugh! Haagh!”
KyungHyun’s curses were drowned out by the loud cries coming from the man. As KyungHyun continued to indiscriminately punch the man’s face, the man was unable to fight back. Once, twice, three times… Every time a blow landed on his face, the man’s leg flinched on the ground.
“…Are you okay?” “Yes… yes…”
EunHa frowned as she gazed at her client who was crying as she watched this scene unfold in front of her eyes. It didn’t look like she was fine at all. Even though her client wasn’t fine, she needed to pull her attention back to the man being beaten by KyungHyun. She felt that she had to stop KyungHyun before things got worse.
“Please wait here for a moment.”

At this rate, KyungHyun was going to lose his mind and end up killing the man. He was a deputy commissioner of the police force now, but he was still a man who spent 10 years as a top figure of a criminal organization. EunHa recalled how he hadn’t even hesitated



to use a knife when they were trapped inside the drug factory in China. She remembered what Lieutenant Han had said about KyungHyun beating Li Kahui almost to the point of death. EunHa felt a shiver run down her spine.”
“Aagh… Aaah… Sir, please save me… Please save… Ugh…” “No. You just need to die.”
The man was beaten to a pulp, but KyungHyun grabbed his head once again. EunHa quickly ran over to them and kicked the man on the ground. Then she shouted at KyungHyun, who was panting for breath.
“He’s already half-dead, so let’s just leave this to the police. Hmm?”
KyungHyun turned his head and saw EunHa’s red, swollen cheek. His face was covered in blood splatters as he slowly blinked his eyes. He finally spoke up in a languid voice.
“…But I’m police.”

His voice sounded shockingly cold and calm. EunHa swallowed, but her mouth was dry. She did her best to smile at him.
“Just endure it. You’re not in your right mind right now.” “No, I’m extremely clear-headed.”
KyungHyun’s face looked extremely cold as he smiled back at her. No, that couldn’t be called a smile at all. EunHa knew that very well. And so she felt even more scared.
Just because she had been hit across the face once, KyungHyun had beaten the man to this state. If she had left him for a moment longer, he might have strangled the man to death and still be left unsatisfied.



“Until the police, no, I mean, until the other policemen come, endure it for a little longer. If you do, I’ll give you some good news.”
However, the fierce gleam in his eyes didn’t disappear.

“I don’t need it.”

“You’ll probably regret saying that. Are you sure?”

EunHa looked at him and quickly answered back. KyungHyun let out a deep breath. His chest began to rise and fall with his ragged breaths.
“Superintendent Shin!” “EunHa-ssi!”
EunHa saw the approaching blurry silhouettes of Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha as they panted for breath. It looked like they had rushed over here from the campsite as soon as they heard the gunshot.
“Ah, damn it…”

EunHa looked back and forth between KyungHyun and the man who had been beaten to a pulp underneath him. She began to chew her lip. She already felt bad enough for following the newly-wed couple on this camping trip. She didn’t want to make it even more complicated for them.
“Clench your teeth.”

KyungHyun lifted a brow and gave her a strange look.

“Hurry. I’m warning you.”

EunHa pulled back her fist. She slammed it down onto his face.



Bam!

Because she had wanted to finish it in one blow, she had used too much power and caused KyungHyun’s head to whip back from the force. He frowned at her as he swept his tongue over his lip. When he felt a small, bleeding cut in his lip, KyungHyun burst out into quiet laughter. It looked like he had finally come back to his senses. This smile was not the same as the one he had given her when he was in the process of beating up the man beneath him.
“Superintendent Shin, did something happen? Did you shoot your gun? You didn’t, right?”
Lieutenant Han panted as she asked frantically. After seeing the man who had been completely beaten up, her face twisted into a grimace.
“It was an attempted murder, Lieutenant Han. That man was trying to push this woman off the cliff.”
EunHa answered in KyungHyun’s stead as he got up from the ground and began to brush himself off.
“Even if that was the case, how could you beat a man to this state?”
With her brows furrowed, Lieutenant Han looked extremely frustrated. General Manager Cha was kneeling on the ground as he placed handcuffs on the man’s wrists. Then he quickly got up and made a phone call.
“It was in self-defense. Look. He was hit too.”

EunHa raised her voice and pointed to the cut on KyungHyun’s lip with wide eyes. KyungHyun took EunHa and began to lead her away.
“I’ll leave you two to handle the rest.”



KyungHyun tossed his cellphone with the evidence of the couple’s conversation over to Lieutenant Han before lifting EunHa into his arms.
“This is useable evidence, right?”

“You can even hear EunHa’s and my voice, so don’t worry.”

Lieutenant Han finally seemed relieved. KyungHyun turned around and began to walk away from the scene.
“Let me down. I can walk by myself.”

KyungHyun didn’t say anything. EunHa let out a sigh. She looked up at the sparkling stars in the night sky.
TN: I mean… that guy is lucky EH was there to save his life. The next update is the last update of Doppio Senso … I need to prepare my heart.







They were sitting inside the tent that was meant for the Lieutenant Han couple. Even though they were only facing each other, the air inside the tent felt suffocating. Lieutenant Han and General Manager Cha returned to their professional selves and were out cleaning up this mess.
YongJoon, who had been on stand-by somewhere else, hastily came over. Thanks to him, the police were able to quickly figure out what had happened. They hastily took the client and her husband and YongJoon back down the mountain in the RV they had brought with them.
KyungHyun’s face was brightly illuminated by the hanging lantern in the tent. His large shadow filled up half the tent. Outside, they heard the crackling of a campfire.
“Lieutenant Han said she’d send us a car tomorrow morning, so let’s just go to sleep.”
EunHa spread out the sleeping bag even though it seemed too small for both of them to use. She was just about to fasten the tent zipper when KyungHyun softly pulled her hand. Facing her, KyungHyun asked her a curt question.
“How’s your body?” “I’m fine.”
If she told him she wasn’t fine, she felt that he’d run down the mountain and actually end up killing the man.



“Be honest if you don’t feel well. Let’s go to the hospital.” “I’m really okay.”
KyungHyun’s eyes narrowed as he silently examined her. Whenever this man kept so silent, it made people feel nervous. She couldn’t figure out what he was thinking right now.
“And we don’t even have a car, so how can we get down the mountain?”
“I can call for a helicopter.”
“How can you use a helicopter for something like this?” “I’ve worked myself to the bone for this country for over 10
years. They can at least send me a helicopter, so it doesn’t matter.”
Judging from his dry voice and expression, he wasn’t joking. It really looked like he was ready to call the authorities and send for a helicopter, so EunHa quickly held up both of her hands.
“I’m seriously okay. Really. Hmm? It just grazed me, that’s all. I probably hit that man way harder.”
The more she rambled, the more KyungHyun’s face hardened.
“…No, the more I think about it, I think we should go.”

EunHa grabbed his face as he took out his cellphone. She pressed her lips onto his and softly whispered.
“Seriously, it’s not that bad.”

As if to console him, she placed kisses on his cheek, forehead, and eyelids. KyungHyun’s body flinched and hardened. He kept his eyes closed as he received the kisses. He let out a deep sigh.



Tap.

He dropped his cellphone and pulled EunHa into his embrace. In an instant, her back touched the floor of the tent. After laying her down, KyungHyun began to fiercely suck her tongue.
“Hm…”

Their clothes rubbed against each other and produced static, but KyungHyun didn’t seem to care. He pushed his tongue into her mouth and rubbed the roof of her mouth. Like a person who was dying of thirst, he sucked and swallowed. He felt her suck his lower lip, and his mind went blank. His fierce black eyes pierced through her as he pulled away.
“I wanted to cut off his arm that dared to hit your face and feed it to the wild animals in the mountain.”
When EunHa blocked his mouth with her hand, KyungHyun began to greedily lick it. She felt his tongue slide between her fingers until her whole hand was covered with traces of him.
“I regret not doing that.”

If EunHa hadn’t stopped him, KyungHyun wouldn’t have been able to control himself. Recalling the events that had just occurred, KyungHyun felt a fire rise in his chest again. EunHa let out a long sigh.
“Calm down.”

The man’s truth slowly flowed out of his swollen lips.

“Only a retarded bastard will feel calm after seeing his woman get hurt.”
He was only like this because she had been hit once. If she had been hit twice, he really might have killed a person in front of her



eyes. EunHa grabbed his face as it turned cold and resolutely opened her mouth.
“I told you I’d give you some good news if you calmed down, but I guess I won’t be able to share it.”
“What is it?”
“Things feel tense right now, so I can’t… hmm…”

EunHa couldn’t finish her sentence because their lips touched and their tongues tangled. This wasn’t a fierce kiss. KyungHyun softly stroked her face and tentatively rubbed her tongue inside her mouth.
KyungHyun knew very well that this kind of kiss would drive EunHa insane. He wouldn’t do this often because whenever their tongues touched, KyungHyun’s control would immediately evaporate, but this time, it was different.
Like a small, baby bird, EunHa’s mouth opened and her tongue stuck out of her mouth. KyungHyun lowered his mouth and softly rubbed her tongue with his as if to soothe her. EunHa’s body began to tremble. KyungHyun stroked her shoulders and whispered in a low, baritone voice.
“Tell me. Things aren’t tense anymore.”

His eyes were incredibly deep as he asked softly. EunHa tried to swallow, but her mouth was dry. She opened her mouth with great effort.
“I…”

Ba-dump, ba-dump.

She felt as if her heart would burst out of her throat.

“Tell me.”



His eyes pierced through her as he urged her to tell him. EunHa continued in a soft but clear voice.
“I’m pregnant.”

She felt even more nervous telling him than when she found out herself with her own eyes and ears. EunHa tried her best to settle her heart that seemed to be on the verge of bursting out of her chest. She carefully observed KyungHyun’s reaction.
“……”

But something was strange. KyungHyun’s face looked too calm. He always had his usual pokerface, but she felt that this kind of news would have surprised or shocked him.
“…Aren’t you surprised?”

An almost imperceptible smile flashed across his face. But that was

it.


“I was surprised.”

“You sure don’t look surprised.”
EunHa tilted her head and narrowed her eyes. There was no way…

A strange suspicion popped inside her head.
“Did you…”

She cautiously opened her mouth and vocalized this suspicion.

“Did you already know?”

The moment she asked, she got her answer. Instead of answering, KyungHyun chuckled and grabbed her face with both of his hands. As he lowered his head for a kiss, EunHa pulled away and looked at him with wide eyes.



“What’s going on? When did you find out?”

EunHa was confident she didn’t let anything show. She had done her best to hide this matter from such a perceptive man like him. So when did he find out?
“Is that important right now?”

“It’s important, so tell me before I get mad.”

“I thought you were acting strange one month ago, but I knew for sure two days ago.”
Two days ago. That was when the client came to the office. It was the day she had her suspicions and suddenly announced that she was going on this camping trip.
That night, KyungHyun had suddenly brought up the topic of pregnancy. EunHa thought it had come out of nowhere, but the more she thought about it, the more she realized that he had already known about it then.
“How did you know?”

“Because your lower stomach turned cute and round?”

EunHa did hear that once she had entered the stable stage, her stomach would increase at a rapid pace. However, she couldn’t tell the difference right now. The only symptom she showed was her sudden cravings. She didn’t even have any morning sickness or weight gain yet.
“Did you really notice because of my body? Don’t lie.”

EunHa didn’t like the look on his face. She looked at KyungHyun suspiciously. Finally, KyungHyun began to speak slowly.
“I’m also a client of your company.”



“…What did you say?”
“I even paid a hefty amount so that I’d get a report of my woman’s every move throughout the day. You didn’t know?”
KyungHyun said these ridiculous words as if they were nothing. Including her, there was only two employees in the company. If she didn’t know about it, then the culprit could only be one person. KyungHyun had approached YongJoon and commissioned work privately, but EunHa found it even harder to believe that YongJoon had been able to keep this from her. EunHa scowled as she glared at him in disbelief.
“That bastard realized I was pregnant and told you?” “No.”
“Then what is it?”

“He tells me things like what you eat, who you’ve met, what you’re investigating… Only a retard wouldn’t realize what was going on with all this information. Ah, that guy is an exception because he’s just plain stupid.”
“Haa… So annoying…”

In the end, KyungHyun was watching over her every move through YongJoon. Telling YongJoon that she was going to the hospital for a check-up was her mistake.
“Then did you know why I wanted to come here?”

“I knew you weren’t coming here for the camping, but I didn’t know the specific details. Your henchman is quite good at following people secretly. He’s got a surprisingly good work ethic. I only realized what was going on after I received a phone call from him that was meant for you. He called to tell you he fucked up.”



Feeling completely deceived, EunHa felt extremely upset. She clenched her fist and pounded his chest.
“Why are you so wicked?”

“You didn’t know? I’m a lot more wicked and dirty than you think.”
It didn’t matter what she said. She was the one who liked him even though she knew what kind of man he was.
“Seriously, you’re just like a gangster…”

“Enough with the small talk. I want to talk about the important matter at hand.”
“You’re now a deputy commissioner, but you went and paid a detective agency to follow your lover. What can be more important than this?”
KyungHyun looked at her and bent down to lick her lips. Then he whispered back.
“You said you were with child. My lover has my child.
That’s the most important thing.”

“You said you already knew. Why did you pretend you didn’t know?”
“You didn’t tell me, so I didn’t feel the need to bring it up.” “…So why did you think that?!”
“Because I was waiting.”

Although he sounded as calm as always, she noticed a subtle agitation in his voice. EunHa blinked her large eyes as she looked into his.



“…For what?”
“I was waiting for you to tell me.” “……”
“If you’re telling me the news yourself, then it means that you’ve made a decision.”
He had hit the mark. EunHa kept her mouth shut. Suddenly, KyungHyun’s sturdy hand lifted her sweater up. He pushed aside her bra and began to caress her breast. His hand was damp.
“Why are you doing this all of a sudden? I’m not done talking.”
“Yeah, I’m not done talking either. When you have the child, will your breast produce milk?”
EunHa was used to KyungHyun’s sex talk by now, but his unexpected words made her blush.
“I’m looking forward to it as much as I’m looking forward to seeing the child’s face. I wonder what your milk will taste like.”
When she heard his animalistic words, EunHa pushed his shoulder and spoke up with a flushed face.
“…You don’t even like kids.” “Why would I hate my own kid?”
KyungHyun asked blankly. It seemed that EunHa still didn’t trust him completely. She was nervously chewing her lips when KyungHyun raised his hand to caress her cheek.
“It’s a male’s instinct to want his seed to take. Just imagining you sleeping with our children makes me hard.”



EunHa spoke softly to settle her trembling voice.

“If you think I won’t be able to go anywhere just because I have a child, then you’re wrong.”
KyungHyun smiled and chuckled. His long eyes narrowed.

“Is that what you were worried about?” “……”
“I’m not a perverted bastard who will use a child to hold on to a woman, EunHa.”
“Even if I have a kid, I won’t give anything up. I’m not going to quit my job.”
“I’ll support you no matter what. Do whatever you want.” He held her gaze. EunHa spoke up once again to make sure. “I’m serious.”
“I’m serious, too. You don’t have to give anything up. Didn’t I tell you this before? Do whatever you want to do and live however you want to live by my side.”
His eyes remained steady as they looked into hers. It was EunHa’s eyes that slightly shook as she listened to his honest thoughts.
“If you do something I don’t like, I’ll run away. So don’t get to complacent.”
KyungHyun’s smile widened. He brought her to him. She could feel his possessiveness oozing out of his hands as they gripped her.
“A child is a child, and you are you. If you want to run away, then run away. I’ll follow you to the depths of hell if I have to. No matter where you go, you’ll always end up back



at my side.”

“But I’m going to take the child with me.” “Even better. It’ll make it easier to catch you.”
He sounded so sure of himself that she couldn’t help but be persuaded. KyungHyun licked her cheek as he grabbed her bottom. His satisfied voice flowed into her ear.
“Every time you run away, I’d like to add a child to the mix so that it’ll be easier to find you.”
He said this jokingly, but he was telling the truth. He laughed softly. KyungHyun had been scared she would do something irreversible without telling him, but he decided not to tell her this. The important thing was that EunHa had gathered her courage to move forward.
“I was honestly really nervous. No, actually, I’m still nervous right now.”
“About what?”
“The child… what if something happens to the child?”

EunHa revealed her innermost thoughts that she had kept hidden away deep inside her heart. She felt like she was always fated to be thrust into dangerous situations. Even today’s incident seemed to be proof of that.
And the man in front of her eyes was probably even more worse off than her. The thing EunHa feared the most was her child being pulled into danger because of its parents. This was the reason why she kept hesitating for days once she realized she was pregnant.
“The things you’re worried about will never happen.”



KyungHyun looked into her eyes as he spoke very clearly. His steady gaze gradually calmed her heart.
“My child will take after you, so they’ll be strong. No, actually, it doesn’t matter whether they’re strong or not.”
He whispered languidly into her ear.

“We’re the parents, so what’s there to worry about?”

His dark eyebrow tilted up as he looked at her questioningly.

“I have confidence that I can protect anything that has to do with us. Could it be that you lack the same confidence?”
If she said this was the case, then she’d lose. EunHa didn’t open her mouth. She merely blinked silently before glaring at him.
“You know you have an awful personality, right?” “Thankfully, there’s a woman like you who’s attracted to
arrogant men with awful personalities.”

EunHa felt the tension melt away as KyungHyun twisted her words.

“When you hit me on my cheek back there, it was actually quite exciting.”
“I never knew you had a preference for something like that.”
“A woman who punches my face and then acts like nothing happened… I never knew such a woman could exist.”
EunHa raised her brow and asked him a question in return.

“So did you fall deeply in love with this said woman who punched you in the face?”



“Thanks to that, I’ve decided to never let a woman like you go.”
“You sound quite determined.” “A lot more than you think.”
EunHa laughed at the audacity of this man. KyungHyun used this chance to rub his cock against her entrance.
“Is it okay to have sex while you’re pregnant?” “Why are you worryign about that now?”
“Now that you’ve made up your mind, I need to be careful.”

KyungHyun didn’t put it in and merely rubbed himself against her. She could feel the impatience in his movements. EunHa placed her hands around his sturdy hips and laughed as she whispered.
“I’ve just passed the unstable period, so it’s okay.”

As soon as she said these words, KyungHyun parted her folds and slid his cock inside her. EunHa’s body trembled as she felt the fullness of him.
“Hnng…”

KyungHyun held her head with both his hands and looked down onto her face. A strange gleam flashed inside his eyes. Now that they were one, KyungHyun slowly called out to her.
“EunHa.” “…What is it?”
“Let me take responsibility for you and our child for the rest of our lives.”



He licked her dry lips. EunHa’s heart began to race nervously.

“What if I don’t want to?”
“…Don’t turn me into a son of a bitch.” “Aah, how scary.”
EunHa murmured jokingly, but KyungHyun’s face didn’t have a trace of laughter.
“I’m going to give you everything you’ve lost.”

When EunHa saw his stubborn expression, she felt a fire burn in her heart. He vowed to fulfill the promise he had just made no matter what. As he looked at her, he continued carefully.
“I’ll give you a family… I won’t let you feel lonely ever again. You don’t have to worry. There will be no need to worry about because I’m going to protect you.”
Her eyes tingled as if someone was blowing into them.

“Then what do I need to do?”

“You just need to do whatever you want to do by my side.”

EunHa wrapped her arms around his neck. When he felt her hot walls tighten around him, KyungHyun’s nose crinkled. EunHa let out a sigh. His short thrusts weren’t enough. She tightened her legs around his hips.
“Hurry… Do it fast.”

The veins in KyungHyun’s neck were more pronounced. Swallowing back a curse, he barely managed to open his mouth.
“I heard that we’re supposed to avoid having intense sex.”



A strained voice left his throat. After she heard his reason for holding back, EunHa laughed.
“If something was going to go wrong, it would have gone wrong a long time ago.”
Thinking back to all the sex they’ve had recently, KyungHyun realized that she wasn’t wrong. He finally entered inside her to the hilt. Then he dug his teeth into the back of her neck and murmured.
“If something happens to our kid, I’ll seriously rip that guy’s head off.”
“I never thought you’d be that worried for our child.” “Do you think I’m being like this because of the child?” “Then what else could it be?”
KyungHyun rubbed his hot lips against her skin. Then he lifted his head and looked into her. His eyes were as deep and as dark as a winter lake.
“I don’t want my woman to lose anything ever again. While you’re by my side, you shouldn’t have to go through anything that causes you to shed a tear.”
EunHa finally realized why KyungHyun had become so insane with anger. He had known that she was pregnant, so he had gotten even more riled up.
And still, KyungHyun had waited for her to tell him herself. If she hadn’t said anything, this man would have pretended not to know until the very end.
To others, KyungHyun came off as a scary and cruel man. However, not to her. EunHa realized just how much this man loved her. No matter what dangers came her way, this man wouldn’t bat an



eye and proceed to protect her. And she, in turn, would grow stronger by his side.
What was I so worried about?

As her heart filled with joy, her body became even more feverish. She never imagined that knowing she wasn’t alone could be such a satisfying feeling.
“Will you do anything I ask?”

“If you want, I’ll even buy you a strawberry farm.”

EunHa knew he wasn’t joking. She swallowed her laughter and pressed her fingers into his sturdy back.
“I’ve eaten enough strawberries. So…”

“What do you want? Just say the word. I’ll do anything you ask.”
“Right now, just show the babies how much their dad loves their mom.”
KyungHyun, who had been pumping into her as he dug his teeth into her neck like a beast, suddenly froze. Then he slowly lifted his head.
“What did you just say?”

“You already know. You’re going to be a dad now. And I’m going to be a mom. Although, I can hardly believe it myself…”
“Not that.”

His brows were furrowed. His dark eyes were shaking, and his beautiful lips were slightly parted as his tongue swept over his lower lip. Then he began to lightly chew on them.



KyungHyun always had a calm expression on his face no matter what situation they were in. It was actually kind of annoying sometimes. However, right now, it looked completely bewildered. This was the expression she had expected to see when she told him the news. KyungHyun slowly continued speaking.
“You said ‘babies’?”

Ah, so he still didn’t know about that.

EunHa hid her satisfaction and answered his question with a curt reply.
“They said it’s twins.” “……”
“In any case, you are quite talented. No, maybe I’m the one who’s talented. So this is what they mean by ‘two birds with one stone’… Hnng!”
EunHa was rambling excitedly when silent fireworks went off behind KyungHyun’s eyes. He had been frozen for a moment, but then he suddenly pulled her into his embrace. He began to bite and lick her as if he were going to eat her up.
Every time his lips and tongue touched her skin, she felt it burn. Through the open flap of the tent, EunHa could see the countless stars sparkling down at her. They were so beautiful that they didn’t seem real. Two shadows tangled into one as they moved.
“I love you.” “Hnng! Aaah!”
She felt his body heat surround her as she raised her arms and wrapped them around his neck. His cock continued to thrust into her. Her body was a mess as it reacted to the intense sensations.



KyungHyun ran his tongue down her eyes, cheek, and neck.

“I love you.” “Haahng! Aaahng…!”
Her body stuck to him as if it didn’t want to part from him. Her wet walls gripped and milked his cock, and every time it pulled out, a wet sound filled the tent. KyungHyun sucked on her swollen breasts before moving up and whispering breathlessly into her ear.
“I love you, EunHa.”
“Me too… Me too… Aaahng…!”

KyungHyun pressed down onto her hips as he thrust inside her once more. Her hips trembled as she was filled to the brim. Her thighs began to shake. She arched her hips as KyungHyun gripped her even tighter. He felt himself approach the peak as he continued to push into her
“I love you.”

He met her eyes and confessed once again. His eyes were filled with a happiness she had never seen before.
“Whoever dares to try and take you away will be shot dead.”
“Idiot.”

EunHa moaned as she felt her climax approach and panted for breath.
“You only need to say you’re happy in moments like this.”

EunHa’s eyes narrowed with laughter. KyungHyun bent down and bit her neck, causing her body to tremble. They both reached the peak together, and KyungHyun whispered into her ear.



He told her he was so happy he thought he was going crazy.

Seeing that he was so happy, EunHa couldn’t help but feel the same way. Love would be difficult if one thought about it that way. However, if one viewed it as something easy, it would become that as well.
He would probably continue to doubt her and feel nervous when it came to her, but she definitely believed they took a step forward today.
I like him. I want to see all the expressions this man makes. I want to be with this man.
“I love you.”

KyungHyun hugged her to his chest and gave her a breathless smile. Then he spoke up in a confident voice.
“I know.”

“So arrogant.”

He spoke so haughtily as he gave her a confident look. Then he wrapped his hand around her cheek. He arrogantly whispered to her.
“And you love me even more for it.”

The bugs were chirping outside, and the campfire continued to burn. A vast amount of stars sparkled in the sky. This was truly an unrealistic night.
Now that she thought about it, a long time ago, there was a young girl who dreamed of going camping with the boy she liked. In this fairytale landscape, EunHa looked up at the man who was smiling down at her. And she gave him a smile back.
-----

THE END.
